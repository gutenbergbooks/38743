<h2 class='chapter' id='clink01'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER I—“LEFT HIGH AND DRY”</a></h2>

<p>“Look out, Dot! You’ll fall off that chair as
sure as you live, child!”</p>

<p>Tess was bustling and important. It was baking
day in the Kenway household. She had the
raisins to stone, and the smallest Kenway was
climbing up to put the package of raisins back
upon the cupboard shelf.</p>

<p>There was going to be a cake for the morrow.
Ruth was a-flour to her elbows, and Aggie was
stirring the eggs till the beater was just “a-whiz.”</p>

<p>Crash! Bang! Over went the chair; down
came Dot; and the raisins scattered far and wide
over the freshly scrubbed linoleum.</p>

<p>Fortunately the little busy-body was not hurt.
“What did I tell you?” demanded the raisin-seeder,
after Ruth had made sure there were no
broken bones, and only a “skinned” place on
Dot’s wrist. “What did I tell you? You are
such a careless child!”</p>

<p>Dot’s face began to “cloud up,” but it did not
rain, for Aggie said kindly:</p>

<p>“Don’t mind what she says, Dot. Leave those
raisins to me. You run get your hat on. Tess
has finished seeding that cupful. Now it’s time
you two young ones went on that errand. Isn’t
that so, Ruth?”</p>

<p>The elder sister agreed as she busily mixed the
butter and flour. Butter was high. She put in
what she thought they could afford, and then she
shut her eyes tight, and popped in another lump!</p>

<p>On a bright and sunny day, like this one, the
tiny flat at the top of the Essex Street tenement
was a cheerful place. Ruth was a very capable
housekeeper. She had been such for two years
previous to their mother’s death, for Mrs. Kenway
had been obliged to go out to work.</p>

<p>Now, at sixteen, Ruth felt herself to be very
much grown up. It is often responsibility and not
years that ages one.</p>

<p>If Ruth had “an old head on green shoulders,”
there was reason for it. For almost all the income
the Kenways had was their father’s pension.</p>

<p>The tide of misfortune which had threatened the
family when the father was killed in the Philippines,
had risen to its flood at Mrs. Kenway’s
death two years before this day, and had now left
the Kenway girls high and dry upon the strand of
an ugly tenement, in an ugly street, of the very
ugliest district of Bloomingsburg.</p>

<p>The girls were four—and there was Aunt
Sarah Stower. There were no boys; there never
had been any boys in the Kenway family. Ruth
said she was glad; Aggie said <i>she</i> was sorry; and
as usual Tess sided with the elder sister, while Dot
agreed with the twelve-year-old Aggie that a boy
to do the chores would be “sort of nice.”</p>

<p>“S’pose he was like that bad Tommy Rooney,
who jumps out of the dark corners on the stairs to
scare you, Dot Kenway?” demanded the ten-year-old
Tess, seriously.</p>

<p>“Why, he couldn’t be like Tommy—not if he
was <i>our</i> brother,” said the smallest girl, with conviction.</p>

<p>“Well, he might,” urged Tess, who professed a
degree of experience and knowledge of the world
far beyond that of her eight-year-old sister.
“You see, you can’t always sometimes tell about
<i>boys</i>.”</p>

<p>Tess possessed a strong sense of duty, too. She
would not allow Dot, on this occasion, to leave the
raisins scattered over the floor. Down the two
smaller girls got upon their hands and knees and
picked up the very last of the dried fruit before
they went for their hats.</p>

<p>“Whistle, Dot—you must whistle,” commanded
Tess. “You know, that’s the only way not to
yield to temptation, when you’re picking up raisins.”</p>

<p>“I—I can’t whistle, Tess,” claimed Dot.</p>

<p>“Well! pucker up, anyway,” said Tess. “You
can’t do <i>that</i> with raisins in your mouth,” and
she proceeded to falteringly whistle several bars
of “Yankee Doodle” herself, to prove to the older
girls that the scattered raisins <i>she</i> found were
going into their proper receptacle.</p>

<p>The Kenway girls had to follow many economies,
and had learned early to be self-denying.
Ruth was so busy and so anxious, she declared
herself, she did not have time to be pretty like
other girls of her age. She had stringy black
hair that never would look soft and wavy, as its
owner so much desired.</p>

<p>She possessed big, brown eyes—really wonderful
eyes, if she had only known it. People sometimes
said she was intellectual looking; that was
because of her high, broad brow.</p>

<p>She owned little color, and she had contracted
a nervous habit of pressing her lips tight together
when she was thinking. But she possessed a
laugh that fairly jumped out at you from her eyes
and mouth, it was so unexpected.</p>

<p>Ruth Kenway might not attract much attention
at first glance, but if you looked at her a second
time, you were bound to see something in her
countenance that held you, and interested you.</p>

<p>“Do smile oftener, Ruth,” begged jolly, roly-poly
Agnes. “You always look just as though
you were figuring how many pounds of round
steak go into a dollar.”</p>

<p>“I guess I <i>am</i> thinking of that most of the
time,” sighed the oldest Kenway girl.</p>

<p>Agnes was as plump as a partridge. When she
tried to keep her face straight, the dimples just
<i>would</i> peep out. She laughed easily, and cried
stormily.</p>

<p>She said herself that she had “bushels of molasses
colored hair,” and her blue eyes could
stare a rude boy out of countenance—only she
had to spoil the effect the next moment by giggling.
Another thing, Agnes usually averaged
two “soul chums” among her girl friends at
school, per week!</p>

<p>Tess (nobody ever remembered she had been
christened Theresa) had some of Ruth’s dignity
and some of Aggie’s good looks. She was the
quick girl at her books; she always got along
nicely with grown-ups; they said she had “tact”;
and she had the kindest heart of any girl in the
world.</p>

<p>Dot, or Dorothy, was the baby, and was a miniature
of Ruth, as far as seriousness of demeanor,
and hair and eyes went. She was a little brunette
fairy, with the most delicately molded limbs,
a faint blush in her dark cheeks, and her steady
gravity delighted older people. They said she
was “such an old-fashioned little thing.”</p>

<p>It was Saturday. From the street below shrill
voices rose in a nightmare of sound that broke in
a nerve-racking wave upon the ears. Numerous
wild Red Indians could make no more savage
sounds, if they were burning a captive at the
stake.</p>

<p>It was the children on the block, who had no
other playground. Dot shuddered to venture
forth into the turmoil of the street, and Tess had
to acknowledge a faster beating of her own heart.</p>

<p>Dot had her “Alice-doll”—her choicest possession.
They were going to the green grocer’s, at
the corner, and to the drug store.</p>

<p>At the green grocer’s they were to purchase a
cabbage, two quarts of potatoes, and two pennies’
worth of soup greens. At the drug store they
would buy the usual nickel’s worth of peppermint
drops for Aunt Sarah.</p>

<p>Every Saturday since Dot could remember—and
since Tess could remember—and since Agnes
could remember—even every Saturday since
Ruth could remember, there had been five cents’
worth of peppermint drops bought for Aunt
Sarah.</p>

<p>The larder might be very nearly bare; shoes
might be out at toe and stockings out at heel;
there might be a dearth of food on the table; but
Aunt Sarah must not be disappointed in her
weekly treat.</p>

<p>“It is the only pleasure the poor creature has,”
their mother was wont to say. “Why deprive
her of it? There is not much that seems to please
Aunt Sarah, and this is a small thing, children.”</p>

<p>Even Dot was old enough to remember the dear
little mother saying this. It was truly a sort of
sacred bequest, although their mother had not
made it a mandatory charge upon the girls.</p>

<p>“But mother never forgot the peppermints
herself. Why should we forget them?” Ruth
asked.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah Stower was a care, too, left to the
Kenway girls’ charge. Aunt Sarah was an oddity.</p>

<p>She seldom spoke, although her powers of
speech were not in the least impaired. Moreover,
she seldom moved from her chair during the
day, where she sewed, or crocheted; yet she had
the active use of her limbs.</p>

<p>Housework Aunt Sarah abhorred. She had
never been obliged to do it as a girl and young
woman; so she had never lifted her hand to aid
in domestic tasks since coming to live with the
Kenways—and Ruth could barely remember her
coming.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah was only “Aunt” to the Kenway
girls by usage. She was merely their mother’s
uncle’s half-sister! “And <i>that’s</i> a relationship,”
as Aggie said, “that would puzzle a Philadelphia
lawyer to figure out.”</p>

<p>As Tess and Dot came down the littered stoop
of the tall brick house they lived in, a rosy, red-haired
boy, with a snub nose and twinkling blue
eyes, suddenly popped up before them. He was
dressed in fringed leggings and jacket, and wore
a band of feathers about his cap.</p>

<p>“Ugh! Me heap big Injun,” he exclaimed,
brandishing a wooden tomahawk before the faces
of the startled girls. “Scalp white squaw! Kill
papoose!” and he clutched at the Alice-doll.</p>

<p>Dot screamed—as well she might. The thought
of seeing her most beloved child in the hands of
this horrid apparition——</p>

<p>“Now, you just stop bothering us, Tommy Rooney!”
commanded Tess, standing quickly in front
of her sister. “You go away, or I’ll tell your
mother.”</p>

<p>“Aw—‘Tell-tale tit! Your tongue shall be
split!’” scoffed the dancing Indian. “Give me
the papoose. Make heap big Injun of it.”</p>

<p>Dot was actually crying. Tess raised her hand
threateningly.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to hurt you, Tommy Rooney,”
she said, decisively, “but I shall slap you, if you
don’t let us alone.”</p>

<p>“Aw—would you? would you? Got to catch
first,” shouted Tommy, making dreadful grimaces.
His cheeks were painted in black and red
stripes, and these decorations added to Dot’s
fright. “You can’t scare me!” he boasted.</p>

<p>But he kept his distance and Tess hurried Dot
along the street. There were some girls they
knew, for they went to the public school with
them, but Tess and Dot merely spoke to them and
passed right on.</p>

<p>“We’ll go to the drug store first,” said the
older girl. “Then we won’t be bothered with the
vegetable bags while we’re getting Aunt Sarah’s
peppermints.”</p>

<p>“Say, Tess!” said Dot, gulping down a dry sob.</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you wish we could get something ’sides
those old peppermint drops?”</p>

<p>“But Ruthie hasn’t any pennies to spare this
week. She told us so.”</p>

<p>“Never <i>does</i> have pennies to spare,” declared
Dot, with finality. “But I mean I wish Aunt
Sarah wanted some other kind of candy besides
peppermints.”</p>

<p>“Why, Dot Kenway! she always has peppermints.
She always takes some in her pocket to
church on Sunday, and eats them while the minister
preaches. You know she does.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it,” admitted Dot. “And I know
she always gives us each one before we go to
Sunday School. That’s why I wish we could buy
her some other kind of candy. I’m tired of pep’mints.
I think they are a most unsat—sat’s<i>fac</i>tory
candy, Tess.”</p>

<p>“Well! I am amazed at you, Dot Kenway,”
declared Tess, with her most grown-up air.
“You know we couldn’t any more change, and
buy wintergreen, or clove, or lemon-drops, than
we could <i>fly</i>. Aunt Sarah’s got to have just what
she wants.”</p>

<p>“Has she?” queried the smaller girl, doubtfully.
“I wonder why?”</p>

<p>“Because she <i>has</i>,” retorted Tess, with unshaken
belief.</p>

<p>The drops were purchased; the vegetables were
purchased; the sisters were homeward bound.
Walking toward their tenement, they overtook
and passed a tall, gray haired gentleman in a
drab morning coat and hat. He was not a doctor,
and he was not dressed like a minister; therefore
he was a curious-looking figure in this part of
Bloomingsburg, especially at this hour.</p>

<p>Tess looked up slyly at him as she and Dot
passed. He was a cleanly shaven man with thin,
tightly shut lips, and many fine lines about the
corners of his mouth and about his eyes. He had
a high, hooked nose, too—so high, and such a barrier
to the rest of his face, that his sharp gray
eyes seemed to be looking at the world in general
over a high board fence.</p>

<p>Dot was carrying the peppermint drops—and
carrying them carefully, while Tess’ hands were
occupied with the other purchases. So Master
Tommy Rooney thought he saw his chance.</p>

<p>“Candy! candy!” he yelled, darting out at
them from an areaway. “Heap big Injun want
candy, or take white squaw’s papoose! Ugh!”</p>

<p>Dot screamed. Tess tried to defend her and
the white bag of peppermints. But she was
handicapped with her own bundles. Tommy was
as quick—and as slippery—as an eel.</p>

<p>Suddenly the gentleman in the silk hat strode
forward, thrust his gold-headed walking stick between
Tommy’s lively legs, and tripped that master
of mischief into the gutter.</p>

<p>Tommy scrambled up, gave one glance at the
tall gentleman and fled, affrighted. The gentleman
looked down at Tess and Dot.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, sir!” said the bigger girl.
“We’re much obliged!”</p>

<p>“Yes! A knight to the rescue, eh? Do you
live on this block, little lady?” he asked, and when
he smiled his face was a whole lot pleasanter than
it was in repose.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Right there at Number 80.”</p>

<p>“Number 80?” repeated the gentleman, with
some interest. “Is there a family in your house
named Kenway?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir! <i>We’re</i> the Kenways—two of
them,” declared Tess, while Dot was a little inclined
to put her finger in her mouth and watch
him shyly.</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed the stranger. “Two of
Leonard Kenway’s daughters? Is your mother
at home?”</p>

<p>“We—we haven’t any mother—not now, sir,”
said Tess, more faintly.</p>

<p>“Not living? I had not heard. Then, who is
the head of the household?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you want to see Ruth,” cried Tess.
“She’s the biggest. It must be Ruth you want
to see.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right,” said the gentleman,
eyeing the girls curiously. “If she is the chief
of the clan, it is she I must see. I have come to
inform her of her Uncle Peter Stower’s death.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink02'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER II—UNCLE PETER’S WILL</a></h2>

<p>Tess and Dot were greatly excited. As they
climbed up the long and semi-dark flights to the
little flat at the top of the house, they clung
tightly to each other’s hands and stared, round-eyed,
at each other on the landings.</p>

<p>Behind them labored the tall, gray gentleman.
They could hear him puffing heavily on the last
flight.</p>

<p>Dot had breath left to burst open the kitchen
door and run to tell Ruth of the visitor.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! Ruthie!” gasped the little girl.
“There’s a man dead out here and Uncle Peter’s
come to tell you all about it!”</p>

<p>“Why, Dot Kenway!” cried Tess, as the elder
sister turned in amazement at the first wild announcement
of the visitor’s coming. “Can’t you
get anything straight? It isn’t Uncle Peter who
wants to see you, Ruth. Uncle Peter is dead.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Peter Stower!” exclaimed Aggie, in
awe.</p>

<p>He was the Kenway girls’ single wealthy relative.
He was considered eccentric. He was—or
had been—a bachelor and lived in Milton, an upstate
town some distance from Bloomingsburg,
and had occupied, almost alone, the old Stower
homestead on the corner of Main and Willow
Streets—locally known as “the Old Corner
House.”</p>

<p>“Do take the gentleman to the parlor door,”
said Ruth, hastily, hearing the footstep of the visitor
at the top of the stairs. “Dot, go unlock that
door, dear.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Sarah’s sitting in there, Ruth,” whispered
Aggie, hastily.</p>

<p>“Well, but Aunt Sarah won’t bite him,” said
Ruth, hurriedly removing her apron and smoothing
her hair.</p>

<p>“Just think of Uncle Peter being dead,” repeated
Aggie, in a daze.</p>

<p>“And he was Aunt Sarah’s half brother, you
know. Of course, neither her father nor mother
was Uncle Peter’s father or mother—their parents
were all married twice. And——”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t!” gasped the plump sister. “We
never <i>can</i> figure out the relationship—you know
we can’t, Ruth. Really, Aunt Sarah isn’t blood-kin
to us at all.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Peter never would admit it,” said Ruth,
slowly. “He was old enough to object, mother
said, when our grandfather married a second
time.”</p>

<p>“Of course. I know,” acknowledged Aggie.
“Aunt Sarah isn’t really a Stower at all!”</p>

<p>“But Aunt Sarah’s always said the property
ought to come to her, when Uncle Peter died.”</p>

<p>“I hope he <i>has</i> left her something—I do hope
so. It would help out a lot,” said Aggie, serious
for the moment.</p>

<p>“Why—yes. It would be easier for us to get
along, if she had her own support,” admitted
Ruth.</p>

<p>“And we’d save five cents a week for peppermints!”
giggled Aggie suddenly, seeing the little
white bag of candy on the table.</p>

<p>“How you do talk, Ag,” said Ruth, admonishingly,
and considering herself presentable, she
went through the bedroom into the front room, or
“parlor,” of the flat. Aggie had to stay to watch
the cake, which was now turning a lovely golden
brown in the oven.</p>

<p>The tall, gray gentleman with the sharp eyes
and beak-like nose, had been ushered in by the
two little girls and had thankfully taken a seat.
He was wiping his perspiring forehead with a
checked silk handkerchief, and had set the high hat
down by his chair.</p>

<p>Those quick, gray eyes of his had taken in all
the neat poverty of the room. A careful and
tasteful young housekeeper was Ruth Kenway.
Everything was in its place; the pictures on the
wall were hung straight; there was no dust.</p>

<p>In one of the two rockers sat Aunt Sarah. It
was the most comfortable rocker, and it was
drawn to the window where the sun came in.
Aunt Sarah had barely looked up when the visitor
entered, and of course she had not spoken. Her
knitting needles continued to flash in the sunlight.</p>

<p>She was a withered wisp of a woman, with
bright brown eyes under rather heavy brows.
There were three deep wrinkles between those
eyes. Otherwise, Aunt Sarah did not show in her
countenance many of the ravages of time.</p>

<p>Her hair was but slightly grayed; she wore it
“crimped” on the sides, doing it up carefully in
cunning little “pigtails” every night before she
retired. She was scrupulous in the care of her
hands; her plain gingham dress was neat in every
particular.</p>

<p>Indeed, she was as prim and “old-maidish” as
any spinster lady possibly could be. Nothing
ever seemed to ruffle Aunt Sarah. She lived sort
of a detached life in the Kenway family. Nothing
went on that she was not aware of, and often—as
even Ruth admitted—she “had a finger in the
pie” which was not exactly needed!</p>

<p>“I am Mr. Howbridge,” said the visitor, rising
and putting out his hand to the oldest Kenway
girl, and taking in her bright appearance in a single
shrewd glance.</p>

<p>On her part, Aunt Sarah nodded, and pressed
her lips together firmly, flashing him another
birdlike look, as one who would say: “That is
what I expected. You could not hide your identity
from me.”</p>

<p>“I am—or was,” said the gentleman, clearing
his throat and sitting down again, but still
addressing himself directly to Ruth, “Mr. Peter
Stower’s attorney and confidant in business—if
he could be said to be confidential with anybody.
Mr. Stower was a very secretive man, young
lady.”</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah pursed her lips and tossed her head,
as though mentally saying: “You can’t tell me
anything about <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>Ruth said: “I have heard he was peculiar, sir.
But I do not remember of ever seeing him.”</p>

<p>“You did see him, however,” said Mr. Howbridge.
“That was when you were a very little
girl. If I am not mistaken, it was when this
lady,” and he bowed to the silent, knitting figure
in the rocking-chair, “who is known as your Aunt
Sarah, came to live with your mother and father.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” said Ruth, hastily. “I do not
know.”</p>

<p>“It was one of few events of his life, connected
in any way with his relatives, of which Mr. Stower
spoke to me,” Mr. Howbridge said. “This lady
expressed a wish to live with your mother, and
your Uncle Peter brought her. I believe he never
contributed to her support?” he added, slowly.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah might have been a graven image, as
far as expressing herself upon <i>this</i> point went.
Her needles merely flashed in the sunlight. Ruth
felt troubled and somewhat diffident in speaking
of the matter.</p>

<p>“I do not think either father or mother ever
minded <i>that</i>,” she said.</p>

<p>“Ah?” returned Mr. Howbridge. “And your
mother has been dead how long, my dear?” Ruth
told him, and he nodded. “Your income was not
increased by her death? There was no insurance?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir.”</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment with some embarrassment,
and cleared his throat again before
asking his next question.</p>

<p>“Do you realize, my dear, that you and your sisters
are the only living, and direct, relatives of Mr.
Peter Stower?”</p>

<p>Ruth stared at him. She felt that her throat
was dry, and she could not bring her tongue into
play. She merely shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>“Through your mother, my dear, you and your
sisters will inherit your Great Uncle Peter’s property.
It is considerable. With the old Corner
House and the tenement property in Milton, bonds
and cash in bank, it amounts to—approximately—a
hundred thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“But—but——Aunt Sarah!” gasped Ruth, in
surprise.</p>

<p>“Ahem! your Aunt Sarah was really no relative
of the deceased.”</p>

<p>Here Aunt Sarah spoke up for the first time,
her knitting needles clicking. “I thank goodness
I was not,” she said. “My father was a Maltby,
but Mr. Stower, Peter’s father, always wished me
to be called by his name. He always told my
mother he should provide for me. I have,
therefore, looked to the Stower family for my support.
It was and is my right.”</p>

<p>She tossed her head and pursed her lips again.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Howbridge. “I understand
that the elder Mr. Stower died intestate—without
making a will, my dear,” he added, speaking again
to Ruth. “If he ever expressed his intention of
remembering your Aunt Sarah with a legacy, Mr.
Peter Stower did not consider it mandatory upon
him.”</p>

<p>“But of course Uncle Peter has remembered
Aunt Sarah in <i>his</i> will?” questioned the dazed
Ruth.</p>

<p>“He most certainly did,” said Mr. Howbridge,
more briskly. “His will was fully and completely
drawn. I drew it myself, and I still have the notes
in the old man’s handwriting, relating to the bequests.
Unfortunately,” added the lawyer, with a
return to a grave manner, “the actual will of Mr.
Peter Stower cannot be found.”</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah’s needles clicked sharply, but she
did not look up. Ruth stared, wide-eyed, at Mr.
Howbridge.</p>

<p>“As was his custom with important papers, Mr.
Stower would not trust even a safety deposit box
with the custody of his will. He was secretive, as
I have said,” began the lawyer again.</p>

<p>Then Aunt Sarah interrupted: “Just like a
magpie,” she snapped. “I know ’em—the Stowers.
Peter was always doing it when he was a
young man—hidin’ things away—’fraid a body
would see something, or know something. That’s
why he wanted to get <i>me</i> out of the house. Oh, I
knew his doin’s and his goin’s-on!”</p>

<p>“Miss Maltby has stated the case,” said Mr.
Howbridge, bowing politely. “Somewhere in the
old house, of course, Mr. Stower hid the will—and
probably other papers of value. They will be
found in time, we hope. Meanwhile——”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?” queried Ruth, breathlessly, as the
lawyer stopped.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stower has been dead a fortnight,” explained
the lawyer, quietly. “Nobody knew as
much about his affairs as myself. I have presented
the notes of his last will and testament—made
quite a year ago—to the Probate Court, and
although they have no legal significance, the Court
agrees with me that the natural heirs of the deceased
should enter upon possession of the property
and hold it until the complications arising
from the circumstances can be made straight.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Sarah! I am so glad for you!” cried
Ruth, clasping her hands and smiling one of her
wonderful smiles at the little old lady.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah tossed her head and pursed her lips,
just as though she said, “I have always told you
so.”</p>

<p>Mr. Howbridge cleared his throat again and
spoke hastily: “You do not understand, Miss
Kenway. You and your sisters are the heirs at
law. At the best, Miss Maltby would receive only
a small legacy under Mr. Stower’s will. The
residue of the estate reverts to you through your
mother, and I am nominally your guardian and
the executor.”</p>

<p>Ruth stared at him, open mouthed. The two
little girls had listened without clearly understanding
all the particulars. Aggie had crept to the
doorway (the cake now being on the table and off
her mind), and she was the only one who uttered
a sound. She said “Oh!”</p>

<p>“You children—you four girls—are the heirs in
question. I want you to get ready to go to Milton
as soon as possible. You will live in the old
Corner House and I shall see, with the Probate
Court, that all your rights are guarded,” Mr.
Howbridge said.</p>

<p>It was Dorothy, the youngest, who seemed first
to appreciate the significance of this great piece
of news. She said, quite composedly:</p>

<p>“Then we <i>can</i> buy some candy ’sides those pep’mint
drops for Aunt Sarah, on Saturdays.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink03'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER III—THE OLD CORNER HOUSE</a></h2>

<p>“Now,” said Tess, with her most serious air,
“shall we take everything in our playhouse, Dot,
or shall we take only the best things?”</p>

<p>“Oh-oo-ee!” sighed Dot. “It’s so hard to ’cide,
Tess, just what <i>is</i> the best. ’Course, I’m going
to take my Alice-doll and all her things.”</p>

<p>Tess pursed her lips. “That old cradle she
used to sleep in when she was little, is dreadfully
shabby. And one of the rockers is loose.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but Tess!” cried the younger girl. “It
was <i>hers</i>. You know, when she gets really growed
up, she’ll maybe want it for a keepsake. Maybe
she’ll want dollies of her own to rock in it.”</p>

<p>Dot did not lack imagination. The Alice-doll
was a very real personality to the smallest Kenway
girl.</p>

<p>Dot lived in two worlds—the regular, work-a-day
world in which she went to school and did her
small tasks about the flat; and a much larger, more
beautiful world, in which the Alice-doll and kindred
toys had an actual existence.</p>

<p>“And all the clothes she’s outgrown—and shoes—and
everything?” demanded Tess. Then, with
a sigh: “Well, it will be an awful litter, and Ruth
says the trunks are just squeezed full right now!”</p>

<p>The Kenways were packing up for removal to
Milton. Mr. Howbridge had arranged everything
with Ruth, as soon as he had explained the change
of fortune that had come to the four sisters.</p>

<p>None of them really understood what the change
meant—not even Ruth. They had always been
used—ever since they could remember—to what
Aggie called “tight squeezing.” Mr. Howbridge
had placed fifty dollars in Ruth’s hand before he
went away, and had taken a receipt for it. None
of the Kenways had ever before even <i>seen</i> so
much money at one time.</p>

<p>They were to abandon most of their poor possessions
right here in the flat, for their great
uncle’s old house was crowded with furniture
which, although not modern, was much better than
any of theirs. Aunt Sarah was going to take her
special rocker. She insisted upon that.</p>

<p>“I won’t be beholden to Peter for even a chair
to sit in!” she had said, grimly, and that was all
the further comment she made upon the astounding
statement of the lawyer, that the eccentric old
bachelor had not seen fit to will all his property
to her!</p>

<p>There was a bit of uncertainty and mystery
about the will of Uncle Peter, and about their
right to take over his possessions. Mr. Howbridge
had explained that fully to Ruth.</p>

<p>There was no doubt in his mind but that the
will he had drawn for Uncle Peter was still in
existence, and that the old gentleman had made no
subsequent disposal of his property to contradict
the terms of the will the lawyer remembered.</p>

<p>There were no other known heirs but the four
Kenway sisters. Therefore the Probate Court
had agreed that the lawyer should enter into possession
of the property on behalf of Ruth and her
sisters.</p>

<p>As long as the will was not found, and admitted
to probate, and its terms clearly established in
law, there was doubt and uncertainty connected
with the girls’ wonderful fortune. Some unexpected
claimant might appear to demand a share
of the property. It was, in fact, now allowed by
the Court, that Mr. Howbridge and the heirs-at-law
should occupy the deceased’s home and administer
the estate, being answerable to the probate
judge for all that was done.</p>

<p>To the minds of Tess and Dot, all this meant
little. Indeed, even the two older girls did not
much understand the complications. What Aunt
Sarah understood she managed, as usual, to successfully
hide within herself.</p>

<p>There was to be a wonderful change in their affairs—that
was the main thing that impressed the
minds of the four sisters. Dot had been the first
to express it concretely, when she suggested they
might treat themselves on Saturdays to something
beside the usual five cents’ worth of peppermint
drops.</p>

<p>“I expect,” said Tess, “that we won’t really
know how to live, Dot, in so big a house. Just
think! there’s three stories and an attic!”</p>

<p>“Just as if we were living in this very tenement
all, all alone!” breathed Dot, with awe.</p>

<p>“Only much better—and bigger—and nicer,”
said Tess, eagerly. “Ruth remembers going
there once with mother. Uncle Peter was sick.
She didn’t go up stairs, but stayed down with a
big colored man—Uncle Rufus. She ’members
all about it. The room she stayed in was as big
as all these in our flat, put together.”</p>

<p>This was too wonderful for Dot to really understand.
But if Ruth said it, it must be so. She
finally sighed again, and said:</p>

<p>“I—I guess I’ll be ’fraid in such rooms. And
we’ll get lost in the house, if it’s so big.”</p>

<p>“No. Of course, we won’t live all over the
house. Maybe we’ll live days on the first floor,
and sleep in bedrooms on the second floor, and
never go up stairs on the other floors at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well!” said Dot, gaining sudden courage—and
curiosity. “I guess I’d want to see what’s
on them, just the same.”</p>

<p>There were people in the big tenement house
quite as poor as the Kenways themselves. Among
these poor families Ruth distributed the girls’
possessions that they did not wish to take to Milton.
Tommy Rooney’s mother was thankful for
a bed and some dishes, and the kitchen table. She
gave Tommy a decisive thrashing, when she caught
him jumping out of the dark at Dot on the very
last day but one, before the Kenways left Essex
Street for their new home.</p>

<p>Master Tommy was sore in spirit and in body
when he met Tess and Dot on the sidewalk, later.
There were tear-smears on his cheeks, but his eyes
began to snap as usual, when he saw the girls.</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” he said. “I’m goin’ to run
away from here, anyway, before long. Just as
soon as I get enough food saved up, and can swap
my alleys and chaneys with Billy Drake for his
air-rifle.”</p>

<p>“Why, Tommy Rooney!” exclaimed Tess.
“Where are you going to run to?”</p>

<p>“I—I——Well, that don’t matter! I’ll find
some place. What sort of a place is this you girls
are going to? Is it ’way out west? If it is, and
there’s plenty of Injuns to fight with, and scalp,
mebbe I’ll come there with you.”</p>

<p>Tess was against this instantly. “I don’t know
about the Indians,” she said; “but I thought you
wanted to be an Indian yourself? You have an
Indian suit.”</p>

<p>“Aw, I know,” said Master Tommy. “That’s
Mom’s fault. I told her I wanted to be a cowboy,
but she saw them Injun outfits at a bargain and
she got one instead. I never did want to be an
Injun, for when you play with the other fellers,
the cowboys always have to win the battles. Best
we Injuns can do is to burn a cowboy at the stake,
once in a while—like they do in the movin’ pitchers.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure there are not any Indians at
Milton,” said Tess. “You can’t come there,
Tommy. And, anyway, your mother would only
bring you back and whip you again.”</p>

<p>“She’d have to catch me first!” crowed the imp
of mischief, who forgot very quickly the smarts of
punishment. “Once I get armed and provisioned
(I got more’n a loaf of bread and a whole tin of
sardines hid away in a place I won’t tell you
where!), I’ll start off and Mom won’t never find
me—no, sir-ree, sir!”</p>

<p>“You see what a bad, bad boy he is, Dot,”
sighed Tess. “I’m so glad we haven’t any
brother.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but if we did have,” said Dot, with assurance,
“he’d be a cowboy and not an Indian, from
the very start!”</p>

<p>This answer was too much for Tess! She decided
to say no more about boys, for it seemed as
impossible to convince Dot on the subject as it was
Aggie.</p>

<p>Aggie, meanwhile, was the busiest of the four
sisters. There were so many girls she had to say
good-by to, and weep with, and promise undying
affection for, and agree to write letters to—at
least three a week!—and invite to come to Milton
to visit them at the old Corner House, when they
once got settled there.</p>

<p>“If all these girls come at once, Aggie,” said
Ruth, mildly admonitory, “I am afraid even
Uncle Peter’s big house won’t hold them.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have an overflow meeting on the
lawn,” retorted Aggie, grinning. Then she
clouded up the very next minute and the tears
flowed: “Oh, dear! I know I’ll never see any of
them again, we’re going away so far.”</p>

<p>“Well! I wouldn’t boo-hoo over it,” Ruth said.
“There will be girls in Milton, too. And by next
September when you go to school again, you will
have dozens of spoons.”</p>

<p>“But not girls like these,” said Aggie, sorrowfully.
And, actually, she believed it!</p>

<p>This is not much yet about the old Corner House
that had stood since the earliest remembrance of
the oldest inhabitant of Milton, on the corner of
Main and Willow Streets.</p>

<p>Milton was a county seat. Across the great,
shaded parade ground from the Stower mansion,
was the red brick courthouse itself. On this side
of the parade there were nothing but residences,
and none of them had been so big and fine in their
prime as the Corner House.</p>

<p>In the first place there were three-quarters’ of
an acre of ground about the big, colonial mansion.
It fronted Main Street, but set so far back from
that thoroughfare, that it seemed very retired.
There was a large, shady lawn in front, and old-fashioned
flower beds, and flowering shrubs. For
some time past, the grounds had been neglected
and some of the flowers just grew wild.</p>

<p>The house stood close to the side street, and its
upper windows were very blank looking. Mr.
Peter Stower had lived on the two lower floors
only. “And that is all you will probably care to
take charge of, Miss Kenway,” said Mr. Howbridge,
with a smile, when he first introduced Ruth
to the Corner House.</p>

<p>Ruth had only a dim memory of the place from
that one visit to it when Uncle Peter chanced to
be sick. She knew that he had lived here with
his single negro servant, and that the place had—even
to her infantile mind—seemed bare and
lonely.</p>

<p>Now, however, Ruth knew that she and her sisters
would soon liven the old house up. It was a
delightful change from the city tenement. She
could not imagine anybody being lonely, or homesick,
in the big old house.</p>

<p>Six great pillars supported the porch roof, which
jutted out above the second story windows. The
big oak door, studded with strange little carvings,
was as heavy as that of a jail, or fortress!</p>

<p>Some of the windows had wide sills, and others
came right down to the floor and opened onto the
porch like two-leaved doors.</p>

<p>There was a great main hall in the middle of the
house. Out of this a wide stairway led upward,
branching at the first landing, one flight going to
the east and the other to the west chambers.
There was a gallery all around this hall on the
second floor.</p>

<p>The back of the Corner House was much less
important in appearance than the main building.
Two wings had been built on, and the floors were
not on a level with the floors in the front of the
house, so that one had to go up and down funny,
little brief flights of stairs to get to the sleeping
chambers. There were unexpected windows, with
deep seats under them, in dark corners, and important
looking doors which merely opened into
narrow linen closets, while smaller doors gave entrance
upon long and heavily furnished rooms,
which one would not have really believed were in
the house, to look at them from the outside.</p>

<p>“Oh-oo-ee!” cried Dot, when she first entered
the big front door of the Corner House, clutching
Tess tightly by the hand. “We <i>could</i> get lost in
this house.”</p>

<p>Mr. Howbridge laughed. “If you stick close to
this wise, big sister of yours, little one,” said the
lawyer, looking at Ruth, “you will not get lost.
And I guarantee no other harm will come to you.”</p>

<p>The lawyer had learned to have great respect
for the youthful head of the Kenway household.
Ruth was as excited as she could be about the old
house, and their new fortune, and all. She had
a little color in her cheeks, and her beautiful great
brown eyes shone, and her lips were parted. She
was actually pretty!</p>

<p>“What a great, great fortune it is for us,” she
said. “I—I hope we’ll all know how to enjoy it
to the best advantage. I hope no harm will come
of it. I hope Aunt Sarah won’t be really offended,
because Uncle Peter did not leave it to her.”</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah stalked up the main stairway without
a word. She knew her way about the Corner
House.</p>

<p>She took possession of one of the biggest and
finest rooms in the front part, on the second floor.
When she had lived here as a young woman, she
had been obliged to sleep in one of the rear rooms
which was really meant for the occupancy of servants.</p>

<p>Now she established herself in the room of her
choice, had the expressman bring her rocking-chair
up to it, and settled with her crocheting in the
pleasantest window overlooking Main Street.
There might be, as Aggie said rather tartly,
“bushels of work” to do to straighten out the old
house and make it homey; Aunt Sarah did not
propose to lift her hand to such domestic tasks.</p>

<p>Occasionally she was in the habit of interfering
in the very things the girls did not need, or desire,
help in, but in no other way did Aunt Sarah show
her interest in the family life of the Kenways.</p>

<p>“And we’re all going to have our hands full,
Ruth,” said Aggie, in some disturbance of mind,
“to keep this big place in trim. It isn’t like a
flat.”</p>

<p>“I know,” admitted Ruth. “There’s a lot to
do.”</p>

<p>Even the older sister did not realize as yet what
their change of fortune meant to them. It seemed
to them as though the fifty dollars Mr. Howbridge
had advanced should be made to last for a long,
long time.</p>

<p>A hundred thousand dollars’ worth of property
was only a series of figures as yet in the understanding
of Ruth, and Agnes, and Tess, and Dot.
Besides, there was the uncertainty about Uncle
Peter’s will.</p>

<p>The fortune, after all, might disappear from
their grasp as suddenly as it had been thrust
into it.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink04'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER IV—GETTING SETTLED</a></h2>

<p>It was the time of the June fruit fall when the
Kenway girls came to the Old Corner House in
Milton. A roistering wind shook the peach trees
in the side yard and at the back that first night,
and at once the trees pelted the grass and the flowers
beneath their overladen branches with the little,
hard green pellets that would never now be
luscious fruit.</p>

<p>“Don’t you s’pose they’re sorry as we are, because
they won’t ever be good for nothing?”
queried Dot, standing on the back porch to view
the scattered measure of green fruit upon the
ground.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about it, Dot. Those that are
left on the trees will be all the bigger and sweeter,
Ruth says,” advised Tess. “You see, those little
green things would only have been in the way of
the fruit up above, growing. The trees had too
many children to take care of, anyway, and had to
shake some off. Like the Old Woman Who Lived
in a Shoe.”</p>

<p>“But I never <i>did</i> feel that she was a real
mother,” said Dot, not altogether satisfied. “And
it seems too bad that all those pretty, little, velvety
things couldn’t turn into peaches.”</p>

<p>“Well, for my part,” said Tess, more briskly,
“I don’t see how so many of them managed to
cling on, that old wind blew so! Didn’t you hear
it tearing at the shutters and squealing because it
couldn’t get in, and hooting down the chimney?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to hear it,” confessed Dot. “It—it
sounded worse than Tommy Rooney hollering
at you on the dark stairs.”</p>

<p>The girls had slept very contentedly in the two
great rooms which Ruth chose at the back of the
house for their bedrooms, and which opened into
each other and into one of the bathrooms. Aunt
Sarah did not mind being alone at the front.</p>

<p>“I always intended havin’ this room when I got
back into this house,” she said, in one of her infrequent
confidences to Ruth. “I wanted it when
I was a gal. It was a guest room. Peter said I
shouldn’t have it. But I’m back in it now, in spite
of him—ain’t I?”</p>

<p>Following Uncle Peter’s death, Mr. Howbridge
had hired a woman to clean and fix up the
rooms in the Corner House, which had been occupied
in the old man’s lifetime. But there was
plenty for Ruth and Agnes to do during the first
few days.</p>

<p>Although they had no intention of using the
parlors, there was quite enough for the Kenway
girls to do in caring for the big kitchen (in which
they ate, too), the dining-room, which they used
as a general sitting-room, the halls and stairs, and
the three bedrooms.</p>

<p>The doors of the other rooms on the two floors
(and they seemed innumerable) Ruth kept closed
with the blinds at the windows drawn.</p>

<p>“I don’t like so many shut doors,” Dot confided
to Tess, as they were dusting the carved
balustrade in the big hall, and the big, hair-cloth
covered pieces of furniture which were set about
the lower floor of it. “You don’t know what is
behind them—ready to pop out!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t anything behind them,” said the practical
Tess. “Don’t you be a little ‘’fraid-cat,’
Dot.”</p>

<p>Then a door rattled, and a latch clicked, and
both girls drew suddenly together, while their
hearts throbbed tumultuously.</p>

<p>“Of course, that was only the old wind,” whispered
Tess, at last.</p>

<p>“Ye-es. But the wind wasn’t ever like that at
home in Bloomingsburg,” stammered Dot. “I—I
don’t believe I am going to like this big house,
Tess. I—I wish we were home in Essex Street.”</p>

<p>She actually burst out crying and ran to Ruth,
who chanced to open the dining-room door. Agnes
was with her, and the twelve year old demanded
of Tess:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with that child? What
have you been doing to her?”</p>

<p>“Why, Aggie! You know I wouldn’t do anything
to her,” declared Tess, a little hurt by the
implied accusation.</p>

<p>“Of course you haven’t, dear,” said Ruth,
soothing the sobbing Dot. “Tell us about it.”</p>

<p>“Dot’s afraid—the house is so big—and the
doors rattle,” said Tess.</p>

<p>“Ugh! it <i>is</i> kind of spooky,” muttered Aggie.</p>

<p>“O-o-o!” gasped Tess.</p>

<p>“Hush!” commanded Ruth, quickly.</p>

<p>“What’s ‘spooky’?” demanded Dot, hearing a
new word, and feeling that its significance was important.</p>

<p>“Never you mind, Baby,” said Aggie, kissing
her. “It isn’t anything that’s going to bite <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>“I tell you,” said Ruth, with decision, “you
take her out into the yard to play, Tess. Aggie
and I will finish here. We mustn’t let her get a
dislike for this lovely old house. We’re the Corner
House girls, you know, and we mustn’t be
afraid of our own home,” and she kissed Dot
again.</p>

<p>“I—I guess I’ll like it by and by,” sobbed Dot,
trying hard to recover her composure. “But—but
it’s so b-b-big and scary.”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all to scare you here, dear,” said
Ruth, briskly. “Now, run along.”</p>

<p>When the smaller girls had gone for their hats,
Ruth said to Aggie: “You know, mother always
said Dot had too much imagination. She just pictures
things as so much worse, or so much better,
than they really are. Now, if she should really
ever be frightened here, maybe she’d never like
the old house to live in at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” said Aggie. “I hope that won’t
happen. For I think this is just the very finest
house I ever saw. There is none as big in sight
on this side of the parade ground. We must be
awfully rich, Ruth.”</p>

<p>“Why—why I never thought of that,” said the
elder sister, slowly. “I don’t know whether we
are actually rich, or not. Mr. Howbridge said
something about there being a lot of tenements
and money, but, you see, as long as Uncle Peter’s
will can’t be found, maybe we can’t use much of
the money.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to work hard to keep this place
clean,” sighed Aggie.</p>

<p>“We haven’t anything else to do this summer,
anyway,” said Ruth, quickly. “And maybe
things will be different by fall.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can find the will!” exclaimed Aggie,
voicing a sudden thought.</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t that be great?”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask Mr. Howbridge if we may look. I expect
<i>he</i> has looked in all the likely places,” Ruth
said, after a moment’s reflection.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll look in the unlikely ones,” chuckled
Aggie. “You know, you read in story books
about girls finding money in old stockings, and in
cracked teapots, and behind pictures in the parlor,
and inside the stuffing of old chairs, and——”</p>

<p>“Goodness me!” exclaimed Ruth. “You are as
imaginative as Dot herself.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tess and Dot had run out into the
yard. They had already made a tour of discovery
about the neglected garden and the front lawn,
where the grass was crying-out for the mower.</p>

<p>Ruth said she was going to have some late vegetables,
and there was a pretty good chicken house
and wired run. If they could get a few hens, the
eggs would help out on the meat-bill. <i>That</i> was
the way Ruth Kenway still looked at things!</p>

<p>The picket fence about the front of the old Corner
House property was higher than the heads of
the two younger girls. As they went slowly along
by the front fence, looking out upon Main Street,
they saw many people look curiously in at them.
It doubtless seemed strange in the eyes of Milton
people to see children running about the yard of
the old Corner House, which for a generation had
been practically shut up.</p>

<p>There were other children, too, who looked in
between the pickets, too shy to speak, but likewise
curious. One boy, rather bigger than Tess, stuck
a long pole between two of the pickets, and when
Dot was not looking, he turned the pole suddenly
and confined her between it and the fence.</p>

<p>Dot squealed—although it did not hurt much,
only startled her. Tess flew to the rescue.</p>

<p>“Don’t you do that!” she cried. “She’s my
sister! I’ll just give it to you——”</p>

<p>But there came a much more vigorous rescuer
from outside the fence. A long legged, hatless
colored girl, maybe a year or two older than Tess,
darted across Main Street from the other side.</p>

<p>“Let go o’ dat! Let go o’ dat, you Sam Pinkney!
You’s jes’ de baddes’ boy in Milton! I
done tell your mudder so on’y dis berry mawnin’——Yes-sah!”</p>

<p>She fell upon the mischievous Sam and boxed
both of his ears soundly, dragging the pole out
from between the pickets as well, all in a flash.
She was as quick as could be.</p>

<p>“Don’ you be ’fraid, you lil’ w’ite gals!” said
this champion, putting her brown, grinning face
to an aperture between the pickets, her white teeth
and the whites of her eyes shining.</p>

<p>“Dat no-’count Sam Pinkney is sho’ a nuisance
in dis town—ya-as’m! My mudder say so. ’F I
see him a-tantalizin’ you-uns again, he’n’ me’ll
have de gre’tes’ bustification we ever <i>did</i> hab—now,
I tell yo’, honeys.”</p>

<p>She then burst into a wide-mouthed laugh that
made Tess and Dot smile, too. The brown girl
added:</p>

<p>“You-uns gwine to lib in dat ol’ Co’ner House?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tess. “Our Uncle Peter lived
here.”</p>

<p>“Sho’! I know erbout him. My gran’pappy
lived yere, too,” said the colored girl. “Ma
name’s Alfredia Blossom. Ma mammy’s Petunia
Blossom, an’ she done washin’ for de w’ite folks
yere abouts.”</p>

<p>“We’re much obliged to you for chasing that
bad boy away,” said Tess, politely. “Won’t you
come in?”</p>

<p>“I gotter run back home, or mammy’ll wax me
good,” grinned Alfredia. “But I’s jes’ as much
obleeged to yo’. On’y I wouldn’t go inter dat old
Co’ner House for no money—no, <i>Ma’am</i>!”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Tess, as the colored girl prepared
to depart.</p>

<p>“It’s spooky—dat’s what,” declared Alfredia,
and the next moment she ran around the corner
and disappeared up Willow Street toward one of
the poorer quarters of the town.</p>

<p>“There!” gasped Dot, grabbing Tess by the
hand. “What does <i>that</i> mean? She says this old
Corner House is ‘spooky,’ too. What does
‘spooky’ mean, Tess?”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink05'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER V—GETTING ACQUAINTED</a></h2>

<p>By the third day after their arrival in Milton,
the Kenway sisters were quite used to their new
home; but not to their new condition.</p>

<p>“It’s just delightful,” announced Agnes. “I’m
going to love this old house, Ruth. And to run
right out of doors when one wants to—with an
apron on and without ‘fixing up’—nobody to see
one——”</p>

<p>The rear premises of the old Corner House were
surrounded by a tight fence and a high, straggling
hedge. The garden and backyard made a playground
which delighted Tess and Dot. The latter
seemed to have gotten over her first awe of the
big house and had forgotten to ask further questions
about the meaning of the mysterious word,
“spooky.”</p>

<p>Tess and Dot established their dolls and their
belongings in a little summer-house in the weed-grown
garden, and played there contentedly for
hours. Ruth and Aggie were working very hard.
It was as much as Aunt Sarah would do if she
made her own bed and brushed up her room.</p>

<p>“When I lived at home before,” she said,
grimly, “there were plenty of servants in the
house. That is, until Father Stower died and
Peter became the master.”</p>

<p>Mr. Howbridge came on this day and brought a
visitor which surprised Ruth.</p>

<p>“This is Mrs. McCall, Miss Kenway,” said the
lawyer, who insisted upon treating Ruth as quite
a grown-up young lady. “Mrs. McCall is a widowed
lady for whom I have a great deal of respect,”
continued the gentleman, smiling. “And
I believe you girls will get along nicely with her.”</p>

<p>“I—I am glad to meet Mrs. McCall,” said Ruth,
giving the widow one of her friendly smiles. Yet
she was more than a little puzzled.</p>

<p>“Mrs. McCall,” said Mr. Howbridge, “will take
many household cares off your shoulders, Miss
Kenway. She is a perfectly good housekeeper,
as I know,” and he laughed, “for she has kept
house for me. If you girls undertook to take care
of even a part of this huge house, you would have
no time for anything else.”</p>

<p>“But——” began Ruth, in amazement, not to
say panic.</p>

<p>“You will find Mrs. McCall just the person
whom you need here,” said Mr. Howbridge, firmly.</p>

<p>She was a strong looking, brisk woman, with a
pleasant face, and Ruth <i>did</i> like her at once. But
she was troubled.</p>

<p>“I don’t see, Mr. Howbridge, how we can <i>afford</i>
anybody to help us—just now,” Ruth said. “You
see, we have so very little money. And we
already have borrowed from you, sir, more than we
can easily repay.”</p>

<p>“Ha! you do not understand,” said the lawyer,
quickly. “I see. You think that the money I
advanced before you left Bloomingsburg was a
loan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir!” gasped Ruth. “We could not accept
it as a gift. It would not be right——”</p>

<p>“I certainly do admire your independence, Ruth
Kenway,” said the gentleman, smiling. “But do
not fear. I am not lending you money without
expecting to get full returns. It is an advance
against your uncle’s personal estate.”</p>

<p>“But suppose his will is never found, sir?” cried
Ruth.</p>

<p>“I know of no other heirs of the late Mr. Stower.
The court recognizes you girls as the legatees in
possession. There is not likely to be any question
of your rights at all. But we hope the will
may be found and thus a suit in Chancery be
avoided.”</p>

<p>“But—but is it <i>right</i> for us to accept all this—and
spend money, and all that—when there is still
this uncertainty about the will?” demanded Ruth,
desperately.</p>

<p>“I certainly would not advise you to do anything
that was wrong either legally or morally,”
said Mr. Howbridge, gravely. “Don’t you worry.
I shall pay the bills. You can draw on me for cash
within reason.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir!”</p>

<p>“You all probably need new clothing, and some
little luxuries to which you have not been always
accustomed. I think I must arrange for each of
you girls to have a small monthly allowance. It
is good for young people to learn how to use money
for themselves.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir!” gasped Ruth, again.</p>

<p>“The possibility of some other person, or persons,
putting in a claim to Mr. Peter Stower’s estate,
must be put out of your mind, Miss Kenway,”
pursued the kindly lawyer. “You have borne
enough responsibility for a young girl, already.
Forget it, as the boys say.</p>

<p>“Remember, you girls are very well off. You
will be protected in your rights by the court. Let
Mrs. McCall take hold and do the work, with such
assistance as you girls may wish to give her.”</p>

<p>It was amazing, but very delightful. “Why,
Ruth-<i>ie</i>!” cried Agnes, when they were alone,
fairly dancing around her sister. “Do you suppose
we are really going to be <i>rich</i>?”</p>

<p>To Ruth’s mind a very little more than enough
for actual necessities was wealth for the Kenways!
She felt as though it were too good to be true.
To lay down the burden of responsibilities which
she had carried for two years——well! it was a
heavenly thought!</p>

<p>Milton was a beautiful old town, with well
shaded streets, and green lawns. People seemed
to have plenty of leisure to chat and be sociable;
they did not rush by you without a look, or a word,
as they had in Bloomingsburg.</p>

<p>“So, you’re the Corner House girls, are you?
Do tell!” said one old lady on Willow Street, who
stopped the Kenway sisters the first time they all
trooped to Sunday School.</p>

<p>“Let’s see; <i>you</i> favor your father’s folks,” she
added, pinching Agnes’ plump cheek. “I remember
Leonard Kenway very well indeed. He broke
a window for me once—years ago, when he was a
boy.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know who did it. But Lenny Kenway
never could keep anything to himself, and he came
to me and owned up. Paid for it, too, by helping
saw my winter’s wood,” and the old lady laughed
gently.</p>

<p>“I’m Mrs. Adams. Come and see me, Corner
House girls,” she concluded, looking after them
rather wistfully. “It’s been many a day since I
had young folks in my house.”</p>

<p>Already Agnes had become acquainted with a
few of the storekeepers, for she had done the errands
since their arrival in Milton. Now they
were welcomed by the friendly Sabbath School
teachers and soon felt at home. Agnes quickly
fell in love with a bronze haired girl with brown
eyes, who sat next to her in class. This was Eva
Larry, and Aggie confided to Ruth that she was
“just lovely.”</p>

<p>They all, even the little girls, strolled about the
paths of the parade ground before returning home.
This seemed to be the usual Sunday afternoon
promenade of Milton folk. Several people
stopped the Corner House girls (as they were already
known) and spoke kindly to them.</p>

<p>Although Leonard Kenway and Julia Stower
had moved away from Milton immediately upon
their marriage, and that had been eighteen years
before, many of the residents of Milton remembered
the sisters’ parents, and the Corner House
girls were welcomed for those parents’ sake.</p>

<p>“We certainly shall come and call on you,” said
the minister’s wife, who was a lovely lady, Ruth
thought. “It is a blessing to have young folk
about that gloomy old house.”</p>

<p>“Oh! we don’t think it gloomy at all,” laughed
Ruth.</p>

<p>When the lady had gone on, the Larry girl said
to Agnes: “I think you’re awfully brave. <i>I</i>
wouldn’t live in the Old Corner House for
worlds.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Agnes, puzzled. “I guess
you don’t know how nice it is inside.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t care if it was carpeted with velvet
and you ate off of solid gold dishes!” exclaimed
Eva Larry, with emphasis.</p>

<p>“Oh, Eva! you won’t even come to see us?”</p>

<p>“Of course I shall. I like you. And I think
you are awfully plucky to live there——”</p>

<p>“What for? What’s the matter with the
house?” demanded Agnes, in wonder.</p>

<p>“Why, they say such things about it. You’ve
heard them, of course?”</p>

<p>“Surely you’re not afraid of it because old
Uncle Peter died there?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! It began long before your Uncle
Peter died,” said Eva, lowering her voice. “Do
you mean to say that Mr. Howbridge—nor <i>anybody</i>—has
not told you about it?”</p>

<p>“Goodness me! No!” cried Agnes. “You give
me the shivers.”</p>

<p>“I should think you would shiver, you poor
dear,” said Eva, clutching at Aggie’s arm. “You
oughtn’t to be allowed to go there to live. My
mother says so herself. She said she thought Mr.
Howbridge ought to be ashamed of himself——”</p>

<p>“But what <i>for</i>?” cried the startled Agnes.
“What’s the matter with the house?”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s haunted!” declared Eva, solemnly.
“Didn’t you ever hear about the Corner House
Ghost?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Eva!” murmured Agnes. “You are fooling
me.”</p>

<p>“No, Ma’am! I’m not.”</p>

<p>“A—a ghost?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Everybody knows about it. It’s been
there for years.”</p>

<p>“But—but we haven’t seen it.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t likely see it—yet. Unless it was
the other night when the wind blew so hard. It
comes only in a storm.”</p>

<p>“What! the ghost?”</p>

<p>“Yes. In a big storm it is always seen looking
out of the windows.”</p>

<p>“Goodness!” whispered Agnes. “What windows?”</p>

<p>“In the garret. I believe that’s where it is always
seen. And, of course, it is seen from outside.
When there is a big wind blowing, people
coming across the parade here, or walking on this
side of Willow Street, have looked up there and
seen the ghost fluttering and beckoning at the windows——”</p>

<p>“How horrid!” gasped Agnes. “Oh, Eva! are
you <i>sure</i>?”</p>

<p>“I never saw it,” confessed the other. “But
I know all about it. So does my mother. She
says it’s true.”</p>

<p>“Mercy! And in the daytime?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes at night. Of course, I suppose it
can be seen at night because it is phosphorescent.
All ghosts are, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“I—I never saw one,” quavered Agnes. “And
I don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all about it,” said Eva, with confidence.
“And I wouldn’t live in the house with a
ghost for anything!”</p>

<p>“But we’ve <i>got</i> to,” wailed Agnes. “We
haven’t any other place to live.”</p>

<p>“It’s dreadful,” sympathized the other girl.
“I’ll ask my mother. If you are dreadfully
frightened about it, I’ll see if you can’t come and
stay with us.”</p>

<p>This was very kind of Eva, Agnes thought. The
story of the Corner House Ghost troubled the
twelve-year-old very much. She dared not say
anything before Tess and Dot about it, but she
told the whole story to Ruth that night, after they
were in bed and supposed the little girls to be
asleep.</p>

<p>“Why, Aggie,” said Ruth, calmly, “I don’t
think there <i>are</i> any ghosts. It’s just foolish talk
of foolish people.”</p>

<p>“Eva says her mother <i>knows</i> it’s true. People
have seen it.”</p>

<p>“Up in our garret?”</p>

<p>“Ugh! In the garret of this old house—yes,”
groaned Agnes. “Don’t call it <i>our</i> house. I
guess I don’t like it much, after all.”</p>

<p>“Why, Aggie! How ungrateful.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. For all of me, Uncle Peter could
have kept his old house, if he was going to leave
a ghost in the garret.”</p>

<p>“Hush! the children will hear you,” whispered
Ruth.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink06'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER VI—UNCLE RUFUS</a></h2>

<p>That whispered conversation between Ruth and
Agnes after they were abed that first Sunday night
of the Kenways’ occupancy of the Old Corner
House, bore unexpected fruit. Dot’s ears were
sharp, and she had not been asleep.</p>

<p>From the room she and Tess occupied, opening
out of the chamber in which the bigger girls slept,
Dot heard enough of the whispered talk to get a
fixed idea in her head. And when Dot <i>did</i> get an
idea, it was hard to “shake it loose,” as Agnes
declared.</p>

<p>Mrs. McCall kept one eye on Tess and Dot
as they played about the overgrown garden, for
she could see this easily from the kitchen windows.
Mrs. McCall had already made herself indispensable
to the family; even Aunt Sarah recognized her
worth.</p>

<p>Ruth and Agnes were dusting and making the
beds on this Monday morning, while Tess and Dot
were setting their playhouse to rights.</p>

<p>“I just heard her say so, so now, Tessie Kenway,”
Dot was saying. “And I know if it’s up
there, it’s never had a thing to eat since we came
here to live.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how that could be,” said Tess, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“It’s just <i>so</i>,” repeated the positive Dot.</p>

<p>“But why doesn’t it make a noise?”</p>

<p>“We-ell,” said the smaller girl, puzzled, too,
“maybe we don’t hear it ’cause it’s too far up—there
at the top of the house.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Tess, thoughtfully. “They eat
tin cans, and rubber boots, and any old thing. But
I always thought that was because they couldn’t
find any other food. Like those castaway sailors
Ruth read to us about, who chewed their sealskin
boots. Maybe such things stop the gnawing feeling
you have in your stomach when you’re hungry.”</p>

<p>“I am going to pull some grass and take it up
there,” announced the stubborn Dot. “I am sure
it would be glad of some grass.”</p>

<p>“Maybe Ruth wouldn’t like us to,” objected
Tess.</p>

<p>“But it isn’t Ruthie’s!” cried Dot. “It must
have belonged to Uncle Peter.”</p>

<p>“Why! that’s so,” agreed Tess.</p>

<p>For once she was over-urged by Dot. Both girls
pulled great sheafs of grass. They held it before
them in the skirts of their pinafores, and started
up the back stairs.</p>

<p>Mrs. McCall chanced to be in the pantry and did
not see them. They would have reached the garret
without Ruth or Agnes being the wiser had
not Dot, laboring upward, dropped a wisp of grass
in the second hall.</p>

<p>“What’s all this?” demanded Agnes, coming
upon the scattered grass.</p>

<p>“What’s what?” asked Ruth, behind her.</p>

<p>“And on the stairs!” exclaimed Agnes again.
“Why, it’s grass, Ruth.”</p>

<p>“Grass growing on the stairs?” demanded her
older sister, wonderingly, and running to see.</p>

<p>“Of course not <i>growing</i>,” declared Agnes.
“But who dropped it? Somebody has gone
up——”</p>

<p>She started up the second flight, and Ruth after
her. The trespassers were already on the garret
flight. There was a tight door at the top of those
stairs so no view could be obtained of the garret.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare!” exclaimed Agnes. “What
are you doing up here?”</p>

<p>“And with grass,” said Ruth. “We’re all
going to explore up there together some day soon.
But you needn’t make your beds up there,” and
she laughed.</p>

<p>“Not going to make beds,” announced Tess,
rather grumpily.</p>

<p>“For pity’s sake, what <i>are</i> you going to do?”
asked Agnes.</p>

<p>“We’re going to feed the goat,” said Dot,
gravely.</p>

<p>“Going to feed <i>what</i>?” shrieked Agnes.</p>

<p>“The goat,” repeated Dot.</p>

<p>“She says there’s one up here,” Tess exclaimed,
sullenly.</p>

<p>“A goat in the garret!” gasped Ruth. “How
ridiculous. What put such an idea into your
heads?”</p>

<p>“Aggie said so herself,” said Dot, her lip quivering.
“I heard her tell you so last night after we
were all abed.”</p>

<p>“A—goat—in—the—gar—ret!” murmured Agnes,
in wonder.</p>

<p>Ruth saw the meaning of it instantly. She
pulled Aggie by the sleeve.</p>

<p>“Be still,” she commanded, in a whisper. “I
told you little pitchers had big ears. She heard
all that foolishness that Larry girl told you.”
Then to the younger girls she said:</p>

<p>“We’ll go right up and see if we can find any
goat there. But I am sure Uncle Peter would not
have kept a goat in his garret.”</p>

<p>“But you and Aggie <i>said</i> so,” declared Dot,
much put out.</p>

<p>“You misunderstood what we said. And you
shouldn’t listen to hear what other people say—that’s
eavesdropping, and is not nice at all.
Come.”</p>

<p>Ruth mounted the stairs ahead and threw open
the garret door. A great, dimly lit, unfinished
room was revealed, the entire size of the main
part of the mansion. Forests of clothing hung
from the rafters. There were huge trunks and
chests, and all manner of odd pieces of furniture.</p>

<p>The small windows were curtained with spider’s
lacework of the very finest pattern. Dust lay thick
upon everything. Agnes sneezed.</p>

<p>“Goodness! what a place!” she said.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there is a goat here, Dot,” said
Tess, becoming her usual practical self. “He’d—he’d
cough himself to death!”</p>

<p>“You can take that grass down stairs,” said
Ruth, smiling. But she remained behind to whisper
to Agnes:</p>

<p>“You’ll have to have a care what you say before
that young one, Ag. It was ‘the <i>ghost</i> in the garret’
she heard you speak about.”</p>

<p>“Well,” admitted the plump sister, “I could
see the whole of that dusty old place. It doesn’t
seem to me as though <i>any</i> ghost would care to live
there. I guess that Eva Larry didn’t know what
she was talking about after all.”</p>

<p>It was not, however, altogether funny. Ruth
realized that, if Agnes did not.</p>

<p>“I really wish that girl had not told you that
silly story,” said the elder sister.</p>

<p>“Well, if there should be a ghost——”</p>

<p>“Oh, be still!” exclaimed Ruth. “You know
there’s no such thing, Aggie.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” concluded Aggie. “The old
house <i>is</i> dreadfully spooky. And that garret——”</p>

<p>“Is a very dusty place,” finished Ruth, briskly,
all her housewifely instincts aroused. “Some day
soon we’ll go up there and have a thorough house-cleaning.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“We’ll drive out both the ghost and the goat,”
laughed Ruth. “Why, that will be a lovely place
to play in on rainy days.”</p>

<p>“Boo! it’s spooky,” repeated her sister.</p>

<p>“It won’t be, after we clean it up.”</p>

<p>“And Eva says that’s when the haunt appears—on
stormy days.”</p>

<p>“I declare! you’re a most exasperating child,”
said Ruth, and that shut Agnes’ lips pretty tight
for the time being. She did not like to be called
a child.</p>

<p>It was a day or two later that Mrs. McCall sent
for Ruth to come to the back door to see an old
colored man who stood there, turning his battered
hat around and around in his hands, the sun shining
on his bald, brown skull.</p>

<p>“Good mawnin’, Missie,” said he, humbly. “Is
yo’ one o’ dese yere relatifs of Mars’ Peter, what
done come to lib yere in de ol’ Co’ner House?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ruth, smiling. “I am Ruth Kenway.”</p>

<p>“Well, Missie, I’s Unc’ Rufus,” said the old
man, simply.</p>

<p>“Uncle Rufus?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Missie.”</p>

<p>“Why! you used to work for our Uncle Peter?”</p>

<p>“Endurin’ twenty-four years, Missie,” said the
old man.</p>

<p>“Come in, Uncle Rufus,” said Ruth, kindly. “I
am glad to see you, I am sure. It is nice of you to
call.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Missie; I ’lowed you’d be glad tuh see
me. Das what I tol’ my darter, Pechunia——”</p>

<p>“Petunia?”</p>

<p>“Ya-as. Pechunia Blossom. Das her name,
Missie. I been stayin’ wid her ever since dey turn
me out o’ yere.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I suppose you mean since Uncle Peter
died?”</p>

<p>“Ya-as, Missie,” said the old man, following her
into the sitting room, and staring around with
rolling eyes. Then he chuckled, and said:
“Disher does seem lak’ home tuh me, Missie.”</p>

<p>“I should think so, Uncle Rufus,” said Ruth.</p>

<p>“I done stay here till das lawyer man done tol’
me I wouldn’t be wanted no mo’,” said the colored
man. “But I sho’ does feel dat de ol’ Co’ner
House cyan’t git erlong widout me no mo’ dan I
kin git erlong widout <i>it</i>. I feels los’, Missie, down
dere to Pechunia Blossom’s.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you happy with your daughter, Uncle
Rufus?” asked Ruth, sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Sho’ now! how you t’ink Unc’ Rufus gwine tuh
be happy wid nottin’ to do, an’ sech a raft o’ pickaninnies
erbout? Glo-ree! I sho’ feels like I was
livin’ in a sawmill, wid er boiler fact’ry on one
side an’ one o’ dese yere stone-crushers on de
oder.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s too bad, Uncle Rufus.”</p>

<p>“Yo’ see, Missie,” pursued the old black man,
sitting gingerly on the edge of the chair Ruth had
pointed out to him, “I done wo’k for Mars’ Peter
so long. I done ev’ryt’ing fo’ him. I done de
sweepin’, an’ mak’ he’s bed, an’ cook fo’ him, an’
wait on him han’ an’ foot—ya-as’m!</p>

<p>“Ain’t nobody suit Mars’ Peter like ol’ Unc’
Rufus. He got so he wouldn’t have no wimmen-folkses
erbout. I ta’ de wash to Pechunia, an’
bring hit back; an’ I markets fo’ him, an’ all dat.
Oh, I’s spry fo’ an ol’ feller, Missie. I kin wait
on table quite propah—though ’twas a long time
since Mars’ Peter done have any comp’ny an’ dis
dinin’ room was fixed up for ’em.</p>

<p>“I tak’ care ob de silvah, Missie, an’ de linen,
an’ all. Right smart of silvah Mars’ Peter hab,
Missie. Yo’ sho’ needs Uncle Rufus yere, Missie.
I don’t see how yo’ git erlong widout him so long.”</p>

<p>“Mercy me!” gasped Ruth, suddenly awakening
to what the old man was getting at. “You mean
to say you want to come back here to <i>work</i>?”</p>

<p>“Sho’ly! sho’ly!” agreed Uncle Rufus, nodding
his head a great many times, and with a wistful
smile on his wrinkled old face that went straight
to Ruth’s heart.</p>

<p>“But, Uncle Rufus! we don’t <i>need</i> you, I’m
afraid. We have Mrs. McCall—and there are only
four of us girls and Aunt Sarah.”</p>

<p>“I ’member Mis’ Sarah very well, Missie,” said
Uncle Rufus, nodding. “She’ll sho’ly speak a
good word fo’ Uncle Rufus, Missie. Yo’ ax her.”</p>

<p>“But—Mr. Howbridge——”</p>

<p>“Das lawyer man,” said Uncle Rufus, “he
neber jes’ understood how it was,” proposed the
old colored man, gently. “He didn’t jes’ see dat
dis ol’ Co’ner House was my home so long, dat no
oder place seems jes’ <i>right</i> tuh me.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said Ruth, softly, but much
worried.</p>

<p>“Disher w’ite lady yo’ got tuh he’p, <i>she’ll</i> fin’
me mighty handy—ya-as’m. I kin bring in de
wood fo’ her, an’ git up de coal f’om de cellar.
I kin mak’ de paf’s neat. I kin mak’ yo’ a leetle
bit gyarden, Missie—’taint too late fo’ some vegertables.
Yo’d oughter have de lawn-grass cut.”</p>

<p>The old man’s catalog of activities suggested
the need of a much younger worker, yet Ruth felt
so sorry for him! She was timid about taking
such a responsibility upon herself. What would
Mr. Howbridge say?</p>

<p>Meanwhile the old man was fumbling in an
inner pocket. He brought forth a battered wallet
and from it drew a soiled, crumpled strip of
paper.</p>

<p>“Mars’ Peter didn’t never intend to fo’get me—I
know he didn’t,” said Uncle Rufus, earnestly.
“Disher paper he gib me, Missie, jes’ de day
befo’ he pass ter Glory. He was a kin’ marster,
an’ he lean on Unc’ Rufus a powerful lot. Jes’
yo’ read dis.”</p>

<p>Ruth took the paper. Upon it, in a feeble
scrawl, was written one line, and that unsigned:</p>

<p>“Take care of Uncle Rufus.”</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>“Who—whom did he tell you to give this to,
Uncle Rufus?” asked the troubled girl, at last.</p>

<p>“He didn’t say, Missie. He warn’t speakin’
none by den,” said the old man. “But I done
kep’ it, sho’ly, ’tendin’ tuh sho’ it to his relatifs
what come yere to lib.”</p>

<p>“And you did right, Uncle Rufus, to bring it
to us,” said Ruth, coming to a sudden decision.
“I’ll see what can be done.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink07'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER VII—THEIR CIRCLE OF INTEREST WIDENS</a></h2>

<p>Uncle Rufus was a tall, thin, brown negro,
with a gently deprecating air and a smile that
suddenly changed his naturally sad features into
a most humorous cast without an instant’s notice.</p>

<p>Ruth left him still sitting gingerly on the edge
of the chair in the dining-room, while she slowly
went upstairs to Aunt Sarah. It was seldom that
the oldest Kenway girl confided in, or advised
with, Aunt Sarah, for the latter was mainly a
most unsatisfactory confidante. Sometimes you
could talk to Aunt Sarah for an hour and she
would not say a word in return, or appear even to
hear you!</p>

<p>Ruth felt deeply about the old colored man.
The twist of soiled paper in her hand looked to
Ruth like a direct command from the dead uncle
who had bequeathed her and her sisters this house
and all that went with it.</p>

<p>Since her last interview with Mr. Howbridge,
the fact that they were so much better off than
ever before, had become more real to Ruth. They
could not only live rather sumptuously, but they
could do some good to other people by the proper
use of Uncle Peter’s money!</p>

<p>Here was a case in point. Ruth did not know
but what the old negro would be more than a little
useless about the Corner House; but it would not
cost much to keep him, and let him think he was
of some value to them.</p>

<p>So she opened her heart to Aunt Sarah. And
Aunt Sarah listened. Indeed, there never was
such a good audience as Aunt Sarah in this world
before!</p>

<p>“Now, what do you think?” asked Ruth,
breathlessly, when she had told the story and
shown the paper. “Is this Uncle Peter’s handwriting?”</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah peered at the scrawl. “Looks like
it,” she admitted. “Pretty trembly. I wouldn’t
doubt, on’y it seems too kind a thought for Peter
to have. He warn’t given to thinking of that old
negro.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Mr. Howbridge would know?”</p>

<p>“That lawyer? Huh!” sniffed Aunt Sarah.
“He might. But that wouldn’t bring you anything.
If he put the old man out once, he would
again. No heart nor soul in a lawyer. I always
<i>did</i> hate the whole tribe!”</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah had taken a great dislike to Mr.
Howbridge, because the legal gentleman had
brought the news of the girls’ legacy, instead of
telling her <i>she</i> was the heir of Uncle Peter. On
the days when there chanced to be an east wind
and Aunt Sarah felt a twinge of rheumatism, she
was inclined to rail against Fate for making her
a dependent upon the “gals’ charity,” as she
called it. But she firmly clung to what she called
“her rights.” If Uncle Peter had not left his
property to her, he <i>should</i> have done so—that is
the way she looked at it.</p>

<p>Such comment as Ruth could wring from Aunt
Sarah seemed to bolster up her own resolve to try
Uncle Rufus as a retainer, and tell Mr. Howbridge
about it afterward.</p>

<p>“We’ll skimp a little in some way, to make his
wages,” thought Ruth, her mind naturally dropping
into the old groove of economizing. “I
don’t think Mr. Howbridge would be <i>very</i> angry.
And then—here is the paper,” and she put the
crumpled scrap that the old colored man had
given her, safely away.</p>

<p>“Take care of Uncle Rufus.”</p>

<p>She found Agnes and explained the situation to
her. Aunt Sarah had admitted Uncle Rufus was
a “handy negro,” and Agnes at once became enthusiastic
over the possibility of having such a
serving man.</p>

<p>“Just think of him in a black tail-coat and white
vest and spats, waiting on table!” cried the
twelve year old, whose mind was full of romantic
notions gathered from her miscellaneous reading.
“This old house just <i>needs</i> a liveried negro servant
shuffling about it—you <i>know</i> it does, Ruth!”</p>

<p>“That’s what Uncle Rufus thinks, too,” said
Ruth, smiling. What had appealed to the older
girl was Uncle Rufus’ wistful and pleading smile
as he stated his desire. She went back to the dining-room
and said to the old man:</p>

<p>“I am afraid we cannot pay you much, Uncle
Rufus, for I really do not know just how much
money Mr. Howbridge will allow us to spend on
living expenses. But if you wish to come——”</p>

<p>“Glo-ree!” exclaimed the old man, rolling his
eyes devoutedly. “Das sho’ de good news for
disher collud pusson. Nebber min’ payin’ me
wages, Missie. I jes’ wanter lib an’ die in de Ol’
Co’ner House, w’ich same has been my home endurin’
twenty-four years—ya-as’m!”</p>

<p>Mrs. McCall approved of his coming, when Ruth
told her. As Uncle Rufus said, he was “spry an’
pert,” and there were many little chores that he
could attend to which relieved both the housekeeper
and the Kenway girls themselves.</p>

<p>That very afternoon Uncle Rufus reappeared,
and in his wake two of Petunia Blossom’s pickaninnies,
tugging between them a bulging bag
which contained all the old man’s worldly possessions.</p>

<p>One of these youngsters was the widely smiling
Alfredia Blossom, and Tess and Dot were glad to
see her again, while little Jackson Montgomery
Simms Blossom wriggled, and grinned, and chuckled
in a way that assured the Corner House girls
of his perfect friendliness.</p>

<p>“Stan’ up—you!” commanded the important
Alfredia, eyeing her younger brother with scorn.
“What you got eatin’ on you, Jackson
Montgom’ry? De <i>wiggles</i>? What yo’ s’pose mammy
gwine ter say ter yo’ w’en she years you ain’t got
yo’ comp’ny manners on, w’en you go ter w’ite
folkses’ houses? Stan’ up—straight!”</p>

<p>Jackson was bashful and was evidently a trial
to his sister, when she took him into “w’ite folks’
comp’ny.” Tess, however, rejoiced his heart
with a big piece of Mrs. McCall’s ginger-cake,
and the little girls left him munching, while they
took Alfredia away to the summer house in the
garden to show her their dolls and playthings.</p>

<p>Alfredia’s eyes grew big with wonder, for she
had few toys of her own, and confessed to the possession
of “jes’ a ol’ rag tar-baby wot mammy
done mak’ out o’ a stockin’-heel.”</p>

<p>Tess and Dot looked at each other dubiously
when they heard this. Their collection of babies
suddenly looked to be fairly wicked! Here was a
girl who had not even a single “boughten” dollie.</p>

<p>Dot gasped and seized the Alice-doll, hugging
it close against her breast; her action was involuntary,
but it did not signal the smallest Kenway
girl’s selfishness. No, indeed! Of course, she
could not have given away <i>that</i> possession, but
there were others.</p>

<p>She looked down the row of her china playmates—some
small, some big, some with pretty,
fresh faces, and some rather battered and with
the color in their face “smootchy.”</p>

<p>“Which could we give her, Dot?” whispered
Tess, doubtfully. “There’s my Mary-Jane——”</p>

<p>The older sister proposed to give up one of her
very best dolls; but Mary-Jane was not pink and
pretty. Dot stepped up sturdily and plucked the
very pinkest cheeked, and fluffiest haired doll out
of her own row.</p>

<p>“Why, Dot! that’s Ethelinda!” cried Tess.
Ethelinda had been found in Dot’s stocking only
the previous Christmas, and its purchase had cost
a deal of scrimping and planning on Ruth’s part.
Dot did not know that; she had a firm and unshakable
belief in Santa Claus.</p>

<p>“I think she’ll just <i>love</i> Alf’edia,” declared
Dot, boldly. “I’m sure she will,” and she thrust
the doll suddenly into the colored girl’s open
arms. “You’ll just take good care of her—won’t
you, Alf’edia?”</p>

<p>“My goodness!” ejaculated Alfredia. “You
w’ite gals don’ mean me ter <i>keep</i> this be-you-ti-ful
doll-baby? You don’t mean <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>“Of course we do,” said Tess, briskly, taking
pattern after Dot. “And here’s a spangled cloak
that belonged to one of my dolls, but she hasn’t
worn it much—and a hat. See! they both fit
Ethelinda splendidly.”</p>

<p>Alfredia was speechless for the moment. She
hugged her new possessions to her heart, and her
eyes winked <i>hard</i>. Then she grinned. Nobody
or nothing could quench Alfredia’s grin.</p>

<p>“I gotter git home—I gotter git home ter
mammy,” she chattered, at last. “I cyan’t
nebber t’ank you w’ite chillen enough. Mammy, she
done gotter thank yo’ for me.”</p>

<p>Uncle Rufus came out and stopped his grandchild,
ere she could escape. “Whar you done got
dat w’ite doll-baby, Alfredia Blossom?” he asked,
threateningly.</p>

<p>Dot and Tess were right there to explain. Uncle
Rufus, however, would not let his grandchild
go until “Missie Ruth,” as he called the eldest
Kenway girl, had come to pronounce judgment.</p>

<p>“Why, Dot!” she said, kissing her little sister,
“I think it is very nice of you to give Alfredia
the doll—and Tess, too. Of course, Uncle Rufus,
she can take the doll home. It is hers to keep.”</p>

<p>Alfredia, and “Jackson And-so-forth,” as Agnes
nicknamed the colored boy, ran off, delighted.
The old man said to Ruth:</p>

<p>“Lor’ bless you, Missie! I done <i>know</i> you is
Mars’ Peter’s relatifs; but sho’ it don’t seem like
you was re’l blood kin to de Stowers. Dey ain’t
nebber give nawthin’ erway—no Ma’am!”</p>

<p>The Kenway girls had heard something about
Uncle Peter’s closeness before; he had been
counted a miser by the neighbors. His peculiar
way of living alone, and seldom appearing outside
of the door during the last few years of his life,
had encouraged such gossip regarding him.</p>

<p>On Main Street, adjoining the premises of the
Corner House, was a pretty cottage in which there
lived a family of children, too. These neighbors
did not attend the same church which the Kenways
had gone to on Sunday; therefore no opportunity
had yet occurred for Tess and Dot to become
acquainted with the Creamer girls. There
were three of them of about the same ages as
Agnes, Tess and Dot.</p>

<p>“They’re such nice looking little girls,” confessed
Tess. “I hope we get to know them soon.
We could have lots of fun playing house with
them, Dot, and going visiting, and all.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Dot. “That one they call Mabel
is so pretty! She’s got hair like our Agnes—only
it’s curly.”</p>

<p>So, with the best intentions in the world, Tess
and Dot were inclined to gravitate toward the
picket fence dividing the two yards, whenever
they saw the smaller Creamer girls out playing.</p>

<p>Once Tess and Dot stood on their side of the
fence, hand in hand, watching the three sisters
on the other side playing with their dolls near the
dividing line. The one with the curls looked up
and saw them. It quite shocked Dot when she
saw this pretty little creature twist her face into
an ugly grimace.</p>

<p>“I hope you see us!” she said, tartly, to Tess
and Dot. “What you staring at?”</p>

<p>The Kenways were amazed—and silent. The
other two Creamer children laughed shrilly, and
so encouraged the one who had spoken so rudely.</p>

<p>“You can just go away from there and stare at
somebody else!” said the offended small person,
tossing her head. “We don’t want you bothering
us.”</p>

<p>“O-o-o!” gasped Dot.</p>

<p>“We—we didn’t mean to stare,” stammered
Tess. “We—we don’t know any little girls in
Milton yet. Don’t you want to come over and
play with us?”</p>

<p>“No, we don’t!” declared the curly head. “We
got chased out of that old place enough, when we
first came to live here, by that old crazy man.”</p>

<p>“She means Uncle Peter,” said Tess to Dot.</p>

<p>“Was he crazy?” asked the wondering Dot.</p>

<p>“Of course he wasn’t,” said Tess, sturdily.</p>

<p>“Yes he was, too!” snapped the Creamer girl.
“Everybody says so. You can ask them. I expect
you folks are all crazy. Anyway, we don’t
want to play with you, and you needn’t stand
there and stare at us!”</p>

<p>The smaller Kenway sisters went meekly away.
Of course, if Agnes had overheard the conversation,
she would have given them as good as they
sent. But Tess and Dot were hurt to the quick.</p>

<p>Dot said to Ruth, at supper: “Was our Uncle
Peter crazy, Ruthie?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said the bigger girl, wonderingly.
“What put such a silly idea into your little
head?”</p>

<p>The tale came out, then. Agnes bristled up, of
course.</p>

<p>“Let me catch them talking to you that way!”
she cried. “<i>I’ll</i> tell them something!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t let us quarrel with them,” urged
Ruth, gently. “But you and Tess, Dot, had better
not put yourselves in their way again.”</p>

<p>“Dey’s berry bad chillen—dem Creamers,”
put in Uncle Rufus, who was shuffling about the
dining-room, serving. Although he was faultless
in his service, with the privilege of an old retainer
when the family was alone, he <i>would</i> assist in the
general conversation.</p>

<p>In Agnes’ eyes, Uncle Rufus made a perfect picture.
Out of his bulging traveling bag had appeared
just the sort of a costume that she imagined
he should wear—even to the gray spats!</p>

<p>“It makes me feel just <i>rich</i>!” the twelve year
old said to Ruth, with a contented sigh. “And
real silver he got out of the old chest, and polished
it up—and the cut glass!”</p>

<p>They began to use the dining-room for meals
after Uncle Rufus came. The old man gently insisted
upon it.</p>

<p>“Sho’ly, Missie, you wants ter lib up ter de
customs ob de ol’ Co’ner House. Mars’ Peter
drapped ’em all off latterly; but de time was w’en
dis was de center ob sassiety in Milton—ya-as’m!”</p>

<p>“But goodness!” ejaculated Ruth, in some timidity,
“we do not expect to be in society <i>now</i>.
We don’t know many people yet. And not a soul
has been inside the door to call upon us since we
arrived.”</p>

<p>However, their circle of acquaintance was
steadily widening.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink08'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER VIII—THE CAT THAT WENT BACK</a></h2>

<p>Agnes put her hand upon it in the pantry and
dropped a glass dish ker-smash! She screamed
so, that Ruth came running, opened the door, and,
as it scurried to escape into the dining-room, the
oldest Kenway girl dodged and struck her head
with almost stunning force against the doorframe.
She “saw stars” for a few moments.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” screamed Agnes.</p>

<p>“Ow! ow!” cried Ruth.</p>

<p>“Whatever is the matter with you girls?” demanded
Mrs. McCall, hurrying in from the front
hall.</p>

<p>She suddenly saw it, following the baseboard
around the room in a panic of fear, and Mrs. McCall
gathered her skirts close about her ankles
and called Uncle Rufus.</p>

<p>“He, he!” chuckled the black man, making one
swoop for Mrs. Mouse and catching her in a towel.
“All disher combobberation over a leetle, teeny,
gray mouse. Glo-ree! s’pose hit had been a rat?”</p>

<p>“The house is just over-run with mice,” complained
Mrs. McCall. “And traps seem to do no
good. I always <i>would</i> jump, if I saw a mouse.
I can’t help it.”</p>

<p>“Me, too,” cried Agnes. “There’s something
so sort of <i>creepy</i> about mice. Worse than spiders.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” moaned Ruth, holding the side of
her head. “I wish you’d find some way of getting
rid of them, Uncle Rufus. I’m afraid of
them, too.”</p>

<p>“Lor’ bress yo’ heart an’ soul, Missie! I done
cotched this one fo’ you-uns, an’ I wisht I could
ketch ’em all. But Unc’ Rufus ain’t much of a
mouser—naw suh! What you-alls wants is a
cat.”</p>

<p>“We ought to have a good cat—that’s a fact,”
admitted Mrs. McCall.</p>

<p>“I like cats,” said Dot, who had come in to see
what the excitement was all about. “There’s one
runs along our back fence. Do you ’spect we
could coax her to come in here and hunt mouses?
Let’s show her this one Uncle Rufus caught, and
maybe she’ll follow us in,” added the hopeful
little girl.</p>

<p>Although this plan for securing a cat did not
meet with the family’s approval, Agnes was reminded
of the cat problem that very afternoon,
when she had occasion to go to Mr. Stetson’s grocery
store, where the family traded.</p>

<p>She liked Myra Stetson, the groceryman’s
daughter, almost as well as she did Eva Larry.
And Myra had nothing to say about the “haunt”
which was supposed to pester the old Corner
House.</p>

<p>Myra helped about the store, after school hours
and on Saturdays. When Agnes entered this
day, Mr. Stetson was scolding.</p>

<p>“I declare for’t!” he grumbled. “There’s no
room to step around this store for the cats.
Myra! I can’t stand so many cats—they’re under
foot all the time. You’ll have to get rid of some
of your pets. It’s making me poor to feed them
all, in the first place!”</p>

<p>“Oh, father!” cried Myra. “They keep away
the mice, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes! Sure! They keep away the mice, because
there’s so many cats and kittens here, the
mice couldn’t crowd in. I tell you I can’t stand
it—and there’s that old Sandy-face with four kittens
in the basket behind the flour barrels in the
back room. Those kittens have got their eyes
open. Soon you can’t catch them at all. I tell
you, Myra, you’ve got to get rid of them.”</p>

<p>“Sandy-face and all?” wailed Myra, aghast.</p>

<p>“Yes,” declared her father. “That’ll be five
of ’em gone in a bunch. Then maybe we can at
least <i>count</i> those that are left.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Myra!” cried Agnes. “Give them to
us.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked the store-keeper’s girl. “Not
the whole five?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Agnes, recklessly. “Mrs. McCall
says we are over-run with mice, and I expect
we could feed more than five cats for a long time
on the mouse supply of the old Corner House.”</p>

<p>“Goodness! Old Sandy-face is a real nice
mother cat——”</p>

<p>“Let’s see her,” proposed Agnes, and followed
Myra out into the store-room of the grocery.</p>

<p>In a broken hand-basket in which some old
clothes had been dropped, Sandy-face had made
her children’s cradle. They looked like four
spotted, black balls. The old cat herself was
with them, and she stretched and yawned, and
looked up at the two girls with perfect trust in
her speckled countenance.</p>

<p>Her face looked as though salt and pepper, or
sand, had been sprinkled upon it. Her body was
marked with faint stripes of black and gray,
which proved her part “tiger” origin. She was
“double-toed” on her front feet, and her paws
were big, soft cushions that could unsheath dangerous
claws in an instant.</p>

<p>“She ought to be a good mouser,” said Agnes,
reflectively. It <i>did</i> look like a big contract to cart
five cats home at once!</p>

<p>“But I wouldn’t feel right to separate the family—especially
when the kittens are so young,”
Myra said. “If your folks will let you take them—well!
it would be nice,” she added, for she was
a born lover of cats and could not think, without
positive pain, of having any of the cunning kittens
cut short in their feline careers.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ruth will be glad,” said Agnes, with assurance.
“So will Mrs. McCall. We need cats—we
just actually <i>need</i> them, Myra.”</p>

<p>“But how will you get them home?” asked the
other girl, more practical than the impulsive Agnes.</p>

<p>“Goodness! I hadn’t thought of that,” confessed
Agnes.</p>

<p>“You see, cats are funny creatures,” Myra declared.
“Sometimes they find their way home
again, even if they are carried miles and miles
away.”</p>

<p>“But if I take the kittens, too—wouldn’t she
stay with her own kittens?”</p>

<p>“Well—p’r’aps. But the thing <i>is</i>, how are
you going to carry them all?”</p>

<p>“Say! they’re all in this old basket,” said Agnes.
“Can’t I carry them just as they are?”</p>

<p>She picked the basket up. Old Sandy-face
just “mewed” a little, but did not offer to jump
out.</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Agnes. “They’re heavy.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t carry them all that way. And
if Sandy saw a dog——”</p>

<p>“Maybe I’ll have to blindfold her?” suggested
Agnes.</p>

<p>“Put her in a bag!” cried Myra.</p>

<p>“But that seems so cruel!”</p>

<p>“I know. She might smother,” admitted
Myra.</p>

<p>“Goodness me!” said Agnes, briskly, “if we’re
going to have a cat, I don’t want one that will
always be afraid of me because I popped her into
a bag. Besides, a cat is a dignified creature, and
doing a thing like that would hurt her feelings.
Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“I guess Sandy-face wouldn’t like it,” agreed
Myra, laughing at Agnes’ serious speech and
manner.</p>

<p>“I tell you what,” the second-oldest Kenway
girl said. “I’ll run home with the groceries your
father has put up for me, and get the kids to come
and help. They can certainly carry the kittens,
while I take Sandy.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed the relieved Myra. She
saw a chance of disposing of the entire family
without hurting her own, or the cats’ feelings,
and she was much pleased.</p>

<p>As for the impulsive Agnes, when she made up
her mind to do a thing, she never thought of asking
advice. She reached home with the groceries
and put them into the hands of Uncle Rufus at
the back door. Then she called Tess and Dot
from their play in the garden.</p>

<p>“Are your frocks clean, girls?” she asked
them, hurriedly. “I want you to go to Mr. Stetson’s
store with me.”</p>

<p>“What for, Aggie?” asked Dot, but quite
ready to go. By Agnes’ appearance it was easy
to guess that there was something exciting
afoot.</p>

<p>“Shall I run ask Ruth?” Tess inquired, more
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Uncle Rufus was watching them from the
porch. Agnes waved her hand to the black man,
as she ushered the two smaller girls out of the
yard onto Willow Street.</p>

<p>“No,” she said to Tess. “Uncle Rufus sees
us, and he’ll explain to Ruth.” At the moment,
she did not remember that Uncle Rufus knew no
more about their destination than Ruth herself.</p>

<p>The smaller girls were eager to learn the particulars
of the affair as Agnes hurried them
along. But the bigger girl refused to explain, until
they were in the grocer’s store-room.</p>

<p>“Now! what do you think of them?” she demanded.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot were delighted with the kittens
and Sandy-face. When they learned that all
four kittens and the mother cat were to be their
very own for the taking away, they could scarcely
keep from dancing up and down.</p>

<p>Oh, yes! Tess and Dot were sure they could
carry the basket of kittens. “But won’t that big
cat scratch you, when you undertake to carry her,
Aggie?” asked Tess.</p>

<p>“I won’t let her!” declared Agnes. “Now you
take the basket right up when I lift out Sandy.”</p>

<p>“I—I’m afraid she’ll hurt you,” said Dot.</p>

<p>“She’s real kind!” Agnes lifted out the
mother-cat. Sandy made no complaint, but kept
her eyes fixed upon the kittens. She was used to
being handled by Myra. So she quickly snuggled
down into Agnes’ arms, purring contentedly.
The two smaller girls lifted the basket of kittens
between them.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is nice,” said Tess, delightedly.
“We can carry them just as easy! Can’t we,
Dot?”</p>

<p>“Then go right along. We’ll go out of that
side door there, so as not to take them through
the store,” instructed Agnes.</p>

<p>Sandy made no trouble at all. Agnes was careful
to walk so that the big cat could look right
down into the basket where her four kittens
squirmed and occasionally squealed their objections
to this sort of a “moving day.”</p>

<p>The sun was warm and the little things could
not be cold, but they missed the warmth of their
mother’s body, and her fur coat to snuggle up
against! When they squealed, Sandy-face
evinced some disturbance of mind, but Agnes
managed to quiet her, until they reached Mrs.
Adams’ front gate.</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams was the old lady who had told the
Kenways about their father breaking one of her
windows when he was a boy. She had shown
much interest in the Corner House girls. Now
she was out on her front porch and saw them
coming along Willow Street.</p>

<p>“Whatever have you girls been up to?” she
demanded, pleasantly enough, but evincing much
curiosity.</p>

<p>“Why, Mrs. Adams,” said Agnes, eagerly.
“Don’t you see? We’ve adopted a family.”</p>

<p>“Humph! A family? Not those young’uns
of Petunia Blossom? I see Uncle Rufus back at
the old Corner House, and I expect the whole
family will be there next.”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Agnes, somewhat surprised by
this speech, “these are only cats.”</p>

<p>“Cats?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m. Cats. That is, <i>a</i> cat and four kittens.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams started down the path to see.
The girls stopped before her gate. At that moment
there was a whoop, a scrambling in the
road, and a boy and a bulldog appeared from
around the nearest corner.</p>

<p>With unerring instinct the bulldog, true to his
nature, came charging for the cat he saw in Agnes’
arms.</p>

<p>Poor old Sandy-face came to life in a hurry.
From a condition of calm repose, she leaped in a
second of time to wild and vociferous activity.
Matters were on a war basis instantly.</p>

<p>She uttered a single “Yow!” and leaped
straight out of Agnes’ arms to the bole of a maple
tree standing just inside Mrs. Adams’ fence.
She forgot her kittens and everything else, and
scrambled up the tree for dear life, while the
bulldog, tongue hanging out, and his little red eyes
all alight with excitement, leaped against the fence
as though he, too, would scramble over it and up
the tree.</p>

<div style='text-align:center'>
<img id='ilink02' src='images/illus-002.jpg' alt=''/>
<p class='caption'>She forgot her kittens and everything else, and scrambled up the tree for dear life.</p>
</div>

<p>“Oh! that horrid dog! Take him away, you
Sammy Pinkney!” cried Mrs. Adams. “Come
into the yard, girls!”</p>

<p>The gate was open, and the little girls ran in
with the basket of kittens. Each kitten, in spite
of its youth, was standing stiff-legged in the basket,
its tiny back arched, its fur on end, and was
“spitting” with all its might.</p>

<p>The mother cat had forgotten her children in
this moment of panic. The dancing bulldog outside
the fence quite crazed her. She ran out on
the first limb of the tree, and leaped from it into
the next tree. There was a long row of maples
here and the frightened Sandy-face went from
one to the other like a squirrel.</p>

<p>“She’s running away! she’s running away!”
cried Agnes.</p>

<p>“Where did you get that cat and those kittens,
child?” demanded Mrs. Adams.</p>

<p>“At Mr. Stetson’s store,” said Agnes, sadly,
as the old cat disappeared.</p>

<p>“She’s going back,” said the lady firmly.
“That’s where she is going. A scared cat always
will make for home, if she can. And now! what
under the canopy are you going to do with that
mess of kittens—without a cat to mother them?”</p>

<p>Agnes was stricken dumb for the moment.
Tess and Dot were all but in tears. The situation
was very complicated indeed, even if the boy had
urged his dog away from the gate.</p>

<p>The four little kittens presented a problem to
the Corner House girls that was too much for
even the ready Agnes to solve. Here were the
kittens. The cat had gone back. Agnes had a
long scratch on her arm—and it smarted. Tess
and Dot were on the verge of tears, while the
kittens began to mew and refused to be pacified.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink09'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER IX—THE VANISHING KITTENS</a></h2>

<p>“What you’ll do with those little tykes, I don’t
see,” said Mrs. Adams, who was not much of a
comforter, although kind-hearted. “You’d better
take them back to Mr. Stetson, Aggie.”</p>

<p>“No-o. I don’t think he’d like that,” said
Agnes. “He told Myra to get rid of them and I
promised to take them away and keep them.”</p>

<p>“But that old cat’s gone back,” decided the
lady.</p>

<p>“I s’pect you’ll have to go after her again,
Aggie,” said Tess.</p>

<p>“But I won’t carry her—loose—in my arms,”
declared the bigger girl, with emphasis. “See
what she did to me,” and she displayed the long,
inflamed scratch again.</p>

<p>“Put her in a bag, child,” advised Mrs. Adams.
“You little ones come around here to the back
stoop and we’ll try to make the kittens drink
warm milk. They’re kind of small, but maybe
they’re hungry enough to put their tongues into
the dish.”</p>

<p>She bustled away with Tess and Dot and the
basket of kittens, while Agnes started back along
the street toward the grocery store. She had
rather lost interest in Sandy-face and her family.</p>

<p>At once Tess and Dot were strongly taken with
the possibility of teaching the kittens to drink.
Mrs. Adams warmed the milk, poured it into a
saucer, and set it down on the top step. Each girl
grabbed a kitten and the good lady took the other
two.</p>

<p>They thrust the noses of the kittens toward the
milk, and immediately the little things backed
away, and made great objections to their introduction
to this new method of feeding.</p>

<p>The little black one, with the white nose and the
spot of white over one eye, got some milk on its
whiskers, and immediately sneezed.</p>

<p>“My goodness me!” exclaimed Dot, worriedly,
“I believe this kitten’s catching cold. Suppose
it has a real <i>hard</i> cold before its mother comes
back? What shall we do about it?”</p>

<p>This set Mrs. Adams to laughing so hard that
she could scarcely hold her kittens. But she
dipped their noses right into the milk, and after
they had coughed and sputtered a little, they began
to lick their chops and found the warm milk
much to their taste.</p>

<p>Only, they did not seem to know how to get at
it. They nosed around the edge of the saucer in
the most ridiculous way, getting just a wee mite.
They found it very good, no doubt, but were unable
to discover just where the milk was.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see such particular things?”
asked the impatient Mrs. Adams. She suddenly
pushed the black and white kitten (the girls had
already called it “Spotty”) right up against the
dish. Now, no cat—not even a very tiny cat like
this one—cares to be pushed, and to save itself
from such indignity, Spotty put out one paw and—splash!—it
went right into the dish.</p>

<p>Oh! how he shook the wet paw and backed
away. Cats do not like to get their feet wet.
Spotty began licking the wet paw to dry it and
right then and there he discovered something!</p>

<p>The milk on it tasted very good. He sat up in
the funniest way and licked it all off, and Dot
danced around, delighted to see him.</p>

<p>A little of the milk had been spilled on the step,
and one of the speckled kittens found this, and
began to lap it up with a tiny pink tongue. With
a little urging the other two kittens managed to
get some milk, too, but Spotty was the brightest—at
least, the girls thought so.</p>

<p>After he had licked his paw dry, he ventured
over to the saucer again, smelled around the edge,
and then deliberately dipped in his paw and proceeded
to lap it dry once more.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he the cunningest little thing that ever
was?” demanded Tess, clapping her hands. Dot
was so greatly moved that she had to sit down
and just watch the black and white kitten. She
could not speak for happiness, at first, but when
she <i>did</i> speak, she said:</p>

<p>“Isn’t it nice that there’s such things as kittens
in the world? I don’t s’pose they are
useful at all till they’re <i>cats</i>, but they are awfully
pretty!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t she the little, old-fashioned thing?”
murmured Mrs. Adams.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot were very much at home and the
kittens were curled up in the basket again in apparent
contentment, when Agnes returned.</p>

<p>She had Sandy-face in a sack, and it was just
about all Agnes could do to carry the cat without
getting scratched again. For Sandy’s claws
came through the flimsy bag, and she knew not
friend from foe in her present predicament.</p>

<p>“I declare! I had no idea cats had so little
sense,” Agnes sighed, sitting down, quite heated.
“Wouldn’t you think she’d be <i>glad</i> to be taken to
a good home—and with her kittens, too?”</p>

<p>“Maybe <i>we</i> wouldn’t have any more sense if
we were being carried in a sack,” said Tess,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Well!” exclaimed Aggie. “She knew enough
to go back to Mr. Stetson’s store, that’s sure.
He had to catch her for me, for Myra was out.
He says we’ll have to watch her for a few days,
but I don’t believe she’d have left her kittens if
that bad Sam Pinkney hadn’t come along with his
dog—do you, Mrs. Adams?”</p>

<p>“No, deary. I think she’ll stay with the kittens
all right,” said the old lady, comfortingly.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go on home, girls,” said Agnes,
rising from the step. “We’ve bothered Mrs.
Adams long enough.”</p>

<p>“We’ve had an awfully nice time here,” said
Tess, smiling at the old lady, and not forgetful of
her manners.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you came, dearies. Come again.
I’m going to have a little party here for you Corner
House girls, some day, if you’ll come to it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just <i>love</i> parties,” declared Dot, her
eyes shining. “If Ruth will let us we’ll come—won’t
we, Tess?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” agreed Tess.</p>

<p>“Of course we’ll come, Mrs. Adams,” cried
Agnes, as she led the way with the me-owing cat
in the sack, while the two smaller girls carried
the sleeping kittens with care.</p>

<p>They reached home without any further adventure.
Ruth came running from Aunt Sarah’s
room to see the kittens. When they let Sandy-face
out of the bag in the dining-room, she scurried
under the sofa and refused to be coaxed
forth.</p>

<p>The children insisted upon taking the kittens
up to show Aunt Sarah, and it was determined to
keep the old cat in the dining-room till evening, at
any rate; so the basket was set down by the sofa.
Each girl finally bore a kitten up to Aunt Sarah’s
room.</p>

<p>Agnes had chosen Spotty for her very own—and
the others said she ought to have her choice,
seeing that she had been through so much trouble
to get the old mother cat and her family—and received
a scratch on her arm, too!</p>

<p>They remained long enough in Auntie’s room
to choose names for all the other three kittens.
Ruth’s was named Popocatepetl—of course,
“Petl,” for short (pronounced like “petal”) is
pretty for a kitten—“reminds one of a flower, I
guess,” said Tess.</p>

<p>Tess herself chose for her particular pet the
good old fashioned name of “Almira.” “You
see,” she said, “it’s sort of in memory of Miss
Almira Briggs who was my teacher back in Bloomingsburg,
and Myra Stetson, who gave us the
cats.”</p>

<p>Dot wavered a long time between “Fairy” and
“Elf” as a name for the fourth kitten, and finally
she decided on “Bungle”! That was because the
little, staggery thing, when put down on the floor,
tried to chase Aunt Sarah’s ball of yarn and bungled
the matter in a most ridiculous fashion.</p>

<p>So, Spotty, Petl, Almira and Bungle, the kittens
became. Aunt Sarah had a soft spot in her
heart for cats—what maiden lady has not? She
approved of them, and the children told her their
whole adventure with Sandy-face and her family.</p>

<p>“Butter her feet,” was the old lady’s single
audible comment upon their story, but the girls
did not know what for, nor just what Aunt Sarah
meant. They seldom ventured to ask her to explain
her cryptic sayings, so they carried the kittens
downstairs with puzzled minds.</p>

<p>“What do you s’pose she meant, Ruth?” demanded
Agnes. “‘Butter her feet,’ indeed.
Why, the old cat would get grease all over everything.”</p>

<p>So they merely put the kittens back into the basket,
and left the dining-room to Sandy-face and
her family, until it was time for Uncle Rufus to
set the table for evening dinner.</p>

<p>“Das old cat sho’ done feel ter home now,”
said the black man, chuckling. “She done got
inter dat basket wid dem kittens an’ dey is havin’
a reg’lar love feast wid each odder, dey is so glad
ter be united once mo’. Mebbe dat ol’ speckled
cat kin clean out de mice.”</p>

<p>Of course, Uncle Rufus was not really a
“black” man, save that he was of pure African
blood. He was a brown man—a rich, chocolate
color. But his daughter, Petunia Blossom, when
she came to get the wash-clothes, certainly proved
to be as black—and almost as shiny—as the
kitchen range!</p>

<p>“How come she is so dreful <i>brack</i>, I sho’ dunno,”
groaned Uncle Rufus. “Her mudder was a
well-favored brown lady—not a mite darker dan
me—an’ as I ’member my pappy an’ mammy,
’way back dere befo’ de wah, wasn’t none o’ dese
common <i>brack</i> negras—no, Ma’am!</p>

<p>“But Pechunia, she done harked back to some
ol’ antsister” (he meant “ancestor”) “wot must
ha’ been marked mighty permiscuous wid de tarbrush.
Does jes’ look lak’ yo’ could rub de soot
off Pechunia wid yo’ finger!”</p>

<p>Petunia was enormously fat, too, but she was a
pretty colored woman, without Uncle Rufus’
broad, flat features. And she had a great number
of bright and cunning pickaninnies.</p>

<p>“How many I got in to-tal, Missie?” she repeated
Ruth’s question. “Lor’ bress yo’!
Sometimes I scurce remember dem all. Dere’s
two merried an’ moved out o’ town. Den dere’s
two mo’ wokin’; das four, ain’t it? Den de good
Lor’ sen’ me twins twicet—das mak’ eight, ef my
’rithmetickle am cor-rect. An’ dere’s Alfredia,
an’ Jackson, and Burne-Jones Whis’ler Blossom
(he done been named by Mis’ Holcomb, de artis’
lady, wot I wok fo’) an’ de baby, an’ Louisa Annette,
an’ an’—— Bress de Lor’, Missie, I
’spect das ’bout all.”</p>

<p>Ruth had lost count and could only laugh over
the names foistered upon the helpless brown babies.
Uncle Rufus “snorted” over the catalog
of his daughter’s progeny.</p>

<p>“Huh! dem names don’t mean nuthin’, an’ so I
tell her,” he grunted. “But yo’ cyan’t put sense
in de head ob a flighty negra-woman—no, Ma’am!
She called dem by sech <i>circusy</i> names ’cause dey
<i>sounds</i> pretty. Sound an’ no sense! Huh!”</p>

<p>Just now, however, the Corner House girls
were more deeply interested in the names of the
four kittens, and in keeping them straight (for
three were marked almost exactly alike), than
they were in the names which had been forced
upon the helpless family of Petunia Blossom.</p>

<p>Having already had one lesson in lapping milk
from a saucer, the kittens were made to go
through the training again after dinner, under the
ministrations of Tess and Dot.</p>

<p>Sandy-face, who seemed to have become fairly
contented by this time, sat by and watched her
offspring coughing and sputtering over the warm
milk and finally, deciding that they had had
enough, came and drank it all up herself.</p>

<p>Dot was rather inclined to think that this was
“piggish” on Sandy’s part.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’re a bit polite, Sandy,” she
said, gravely, to the mother cat while the latter
calmly washed her face. “You had your dinner,
you know, before Mrs. McCall brought in the
milk.”</p>

<p>They all trooped out to see Uncle Rufus establish
Sandy and her family for the night in the
woodshed. The cat seemed to fancy the nest in
the old basket, so they did not change it, and
when they left the family, shutting the woodshed
door tightly, they supposed Sandy and her children
would be safe for the night.</p>

<p>In the morning, however, a surprise awaited
Tess and Dot, when they ran out to the shed to
see how the kittens were. Sandy-face was sleeping
soundly in the basket and Spotty and Petl
were crawling all over her. Almira and Bungle
had disappeared!</p>

<p>The two smallest girls searched all about the
shed, and then a wail arose from Dot, when she
was assured that her own, and Tess’ kitten, were
really not to be found. Dot’s voice brought the
whole family, including Uncle Rufus, to the shed
door.</p>

<p>“Al-mi-ra and Bungle’s lost-ed!” sobbed Dot.
“Somebody came and took them, while poor
Sandy was asleep. See!”</p>

<p>It was true. Not a trace of the missing kittens
could be found. The shed door had not been
opened by any of the family before Tess and Dot
arrived. There was only a small window, high
up in the end wall of the shed, open a very little
way for ventilation.</p>

<p>How could the kittens have gotten away without
human help? It did look as though Almira
and Bungle had been stolen. At least, they had
vanished, and even Dot did not believe that there
were kitten fairies who could bewitch Sandy’s
children and spirit them away!</p>

<p>Sandy-face herself seemed the least disturbed
of anybody over the lost kittens. Uncle Rufus
declared that “das cat sho’ nuff cyan’t count.
She done t’ink she’s sho’ got all de kittens she ever
had.”</p>

<p>“I do believe it was that Sam Pinkney boy,”
whispered Tess, to Agnes. “He’s just as bad as
Tommy Rooney was—every bit!”</p>

<p>“But how would he know where we had housed
the kittens for the night?” demanded Agnes. “I
don’t see why anybody should want to take two
little, teeny kittens from their mother.”</p>

<p>Tess and Dot watched closely the remainder
of Sandy’s family. They believed that the
mother cat <i>did</i> discover at last that she was
“short” two kittens, for she did not seem satisfied
with her home in the woodshed. Twice they
caught her with a kitten in her mouth, outside
the woodshed door, which had been left open.</p>

<p>“Now, Sandy,” said Dot, seriously, “you
mustn’t try to move Spotty and Petl. First thing
you know you’ll lose them <i>all</i>; then you won’t have
any kittens. And I don’t believe they like being
carried by the backs of their necks—I don’t. For
they just <i>squall</i>!”</p>

<p>Sandy seemed offended by the girls’ interference,
and she went off by herself and remained
out of sight for half a day. Tess and Dot began
to be worried about the mother cat before Sandy
turned up again and snuggled the two remaining
kittens in the basket, once more.</p>

<p>That second evening they shut the cat and her
two kittens into the shed just as carefully as before.
In the morning only Spotty was left! The
speckled little Popocatepetl had vanished, too!</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink10'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER X—RUTH SEES SOMETHING</a></h2>

<p>The mystery of the vanishing kittens cast a
cloud of gloom over the minds of the younger
Corner House girls. Besides, it had rained in
the night and was still raining after breakfast.
It was a dull, gloomy day.</p>

<p>“Just a nice day for us to start cleaning the
garret,” Ruth said, trying to put cheer into the
hearts of her sisters. “Only Mr. Howbridge,
who has been away, has written me to come to his
office this forenoon. He wants to arrange about
several matters, he says. I’ll have to go and
we’ll postpone the garret rummage till I get
back.”</p>

<p>“Poor Sandy’s all wet and muddy,” said Dot,
who could not get her troubled mind off the cat
family. “Just as though <i>she’d</i> been out in the
rain. But I don’t see how that could be. She’s
washing up now by the kitchen stove.”</p>

<p>They had brought the mother cat and Spotty
into the kitchen for safety. Uncle Rufus shook
his head over the mysterious disappearance of
Petl, Almira and Bungle, too; whispering to Mrs.
McCall:</p>

<p>“Do look for sho’ as though rats had got dem
kittins. Dunno what else.”</p>

<p>“For goodness sake, don’t tell me there are
rats here, Uncle Rufus!” exclaimed the widow,
anxiously. “I couldn’t sleep in my bed nights.”</p>

<p>“Dunno whar you’d sleep safer, Mis’ McCall,
ter git away from ’em,” chuckled the old colored
man. “But I exemplifies de fac’ dat I ain’t seed
none ob dere tracks.”</p>

<p>Occasionally Uncle Rufus “threw in a word”
in conversation which sounded euphonious in his
own ears, but had little to do with the real meaning
of his speech.</p>

<p>Nobody whispered “rats” to the little girls;
and Tess and Dot scarcely let Sandy and the remaining
kitten out of their sight. It was a windy,
storm-stricken day, and they took the mother cat
and Spotty up to Aunt Sarah’s room to play.</p>

<p>Ruth put on her rain-coat, seized an umbrella,
and ventured forth. She knew she could find her
way to Mr. Howbridge’s office, down town, although
she had never visited it before.</p>

<p>The lawyer was very glad to see the oldest Corner
House girl, and told her so. “I am hearing
some good reports of you, Miss Kenway,” he
said, smiling at her in his odd way, and with his
keen eyes looking sharply over the high bridge of
his nose, as though he were gazing deep into
Ruth’s mind.</p>

<p>“Some of these Milton people think that you
girls need closer watching than you are getting.
So they say. What do you think? Do you feel
the need of a sterner guardian?”</p>

<p>“I think you are a very nice guardian,” admitted
Ruth, shyly. “And we are having awfully
nice times up there at the old Corner House,
Mr. Howbridge. I hope we are not spending too
much money?”</p>

<p>He put on his eyeglasses again and scanned the
totals of the store bills and other memoranda she
had brought him. He shook his head and smiled
again:</p>

<p>“I believe you are a born housekeeper. Of
course, I knew that Mrs. McCall wouldn’t let you
go far wrong. But I see no evidence of a lack of
economy on your part. And now, we must see
about your spending some more money, Miss
Kenway.”</p>

<p>“Oh! it seems like a lot to me,” said Ruth,
faintly. “And—and I must tell you something
perhaps you won’t like. We—we have an addition
to the family.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” he asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>“We—we have Uncle Rufus,” explained Ruth.</p>

<p>“What! has that old darkey come bothering
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh! he isn’t a bother. Not at all. I thought
he was too old to do much, but he is <i>so</i> handy—and
he finds so many little things to do. And
then——Why, Mr. Howbridge! it’s just like home
to him.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Undoubtedly. And so he told you?
Worked on your feelings? You are going to have
the whole family on you, next. You will have
more wages to pay out than the estate will
stand.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, sir!” cried Ruth. “Don’t say that.
I am not paying Uncle Rufus a penny. I told him
I couldn’t—until I had seen you about it, at least.
And he is willing to stay anyhow—so he says.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that old darkey,” said Mr.
Howbridge, slowly. “I believe he knew more
about Mr. Peter Stower’s private affairs than he
seemed willing to tell the time I talked to him after
your Uncle Peter’s death. I don’t know about
your keeping him there.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he may know where Uncle Peter
hid his private papers, sir?” asked Ruth, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. He’s an ignorant old negro. He
might get the papers into his hands, and the will
might be lost forever.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir!” cried Ruth, earnestly, “I don’t think
Uncle Rufus is at all dishonest. I asked him
about Uncle Peter’s hiding away things. He
knows what folks say about uncle’s being a miser.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said Mr. Howbridge, questioningly.</p>

<p>“Uncle Rufus says he knows his old master was
that way. Aunt Sarah says Uncle Peter was just
like a magpie—that he hid away things without
any real reason for it.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Miss Maltby was not fond of Mr. Peter
Stower. They did not get along well together.”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I fancy not. And of course, Aunt
Sarah doesn’t say much, anyway. She is real
hurt to think that he did not leave her the house
and money instead of leaving it to us,” and Ruth
sighed.</p>

<p>“Oh, he left her enough in his will to keep her in
comfort for the remainder of her life. She need
not be envious,” said the lawyer, carelessly.</p>

<p>“Well,” sighed Ruth, “that isn’t what Aunt
Sarah wanted. She feels she ought to own the
house. But we can’t help that, can we!”</p>

<p>“No. Do not worry about your Aunt Sarah’s
fidgets,” said the lawyer, smiling once more.
“But about Uncle Rufus?”</p>

<p>Ruth had opened her bag, and now drew forth
the scrap of paper Uncle Rufus had given her.
“Who do you think wrote that, sir?” she asked
Mr. Howbridge, simply.</p>

<p>The moment the lawyer saw it he scowled. Staring
at the paper fixedly for some moments in silence,
he finally asked:</p>

<p>“When did the old darkey say he was given
this?”</p>

<p>“The day before Uncle Peter died. He said
the poor old gentleman couldn’t talk, then, but he
managed to write that line. <i>Is</i> it Uncle Peter’s
handwriting?”</p>

<p>“It certainly is. Shaky, but plainly Mr. Stower’s
own hand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir! let us keep Uncle Rufus, then,” begged
Ruth, quickly.</p>

<p>“But you understand, Miss Kenway, that this
request, unsigned as it is, hasn’t an iota of legal
weight?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care!” said Ruth.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t the old man show it to me?”</p>

<p>“He was keeping it to show to the relatives of
Uncle Peter who, he expected, would have the old
Corner House.”</p>

<p>“Ha! and he was afraid of the lawyer, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“You—you were not very sympathetic, were
you?” said Ruth, slowly.</p>

<p>“Right! I wasn’t. I could not be. I did not
see my way clear to making any provision for
Uncle Rufus, for I knew very well that Mr. Stower
had not mentioned the old serving man in his will.”</p>

<p>“Well—you’ll let us keep him?”</p>

<p>“If you like. I’ll see that he has a little money
every month, too. And now I must not give you
much more time to-day, my dear. But I wish to
put this envelope into your hand. In it you will
find the amount of money which I consider wise
for each of you girls to spend monthly—your allowance,
I mean.</p>

<p>“Such dresses as you need, will be paid for separately.
You will find that a charge account has
been opened for you at this store,” and he passed
the surprised Ruth the business card of the largest
department store in town. “But buy wisely. If
you spend too much, be sure you will hear from
me. The monthly allowance is pin-money.
Squander it as you please without accounting to
me—only to your own consciences,” and he
laughed and rose to show her out of his private
office.</p>

<p>Ruth thanked him and slipped the bulky envelope
into her bag. She could not open it there,
or on the street, and she hurried homeward, eager
to see just what Mr. Howbridge considered a
proper allowance for the Corner House Girls to
“squander.”</p>

<p>The east wind was tearing across the parade
ground and the trees overhead, as Ruth started
over the big common, writhed in the clutch of it.
The rain came in fitful dashes. The girl sheltered
herself as best she could with the umbrella.</p>

<p>Such gusts are hard to judge, however. Although
she clung to the umbrella with both hands,
one savage squall swept down upon Ruth Kenway
and fairly snatched the umbrella from her grasp.
It whirled away over the wet lawn, and turned inside
out!</p>

<p>“No use chasing <i>that</i> thing,” said Ruth, in disgust.
“It’s past repairing. I’ll just have to face
it.”</p>

<p>She hurried on, her head bowed before the slanting
rain. She came to the Willow Street crossing
and glanced up at the old Corner House. Not only
could she see the great, frowning front of the
mansion, with its four huge pillars, but she could
view, too, the side next to Willow Street.</p>

<p>Nobody was looking out of the windows on the
watch for her, that she could see. The parlors
were on this side of the main building, and the girls
did not use them. Above, on the second floor, were
the sleeping room and library in which Uncle Peter
had spent the last years of his life.</p>

<p>Above those blind windows was another row of
windows on the third floor, with the shades pulled
down tightly. And then, above those, in the peak
of the roof, were several small garret windows.</p>

<p>“That’s where that girl said the ghost came and
looked out,” Ruth said aloud, stopping suddenly.</p>

<p>And just at that identical moment the ghost <i>did</i>
look out!</p>

<p>Ruth saw it. Only for a moment, but just as
plain as plain could be! A white, fluttering figure—a
sort of faceless figure with what seemed to be
long garments fluttering about it.</p>

<p>Nobody ever has to see a ghost to know just what
one looks like. People who see ghosts recognize
their appearance by intuition. This was the garret
ghost of the old Corner House, and Ruth was
the first of the Kenway girls to see it.</p>

<p>She had made fun of Agnes’ belief in things supernatural,
but she could not control the shaking
of her own limbs now. It was visible up there at
the garret window for only half a minute; yet
Ruth knew it was no hallucination.</p>

<p>It disappeared with a jump. She did not wait
to see if it came back again, but scurried across the
street and in at the side gate, and so to the back
porch, with scarcely a breath left in her body.</p>

<p>Ruth was just as scared as she could be.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink11'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XI—IN THE GARRET</a></h2>

<p>It would never do to burst into the house and
scare the younger girls. This thought halted
Ruth Kenway, with her hand upon the knob of the
outer door.</p>

<p>She waited, getting her breath back slowly, and
recovering from the shock that had set every nerve
in her body trembling. Of course she did not believe
in ghosts! Then, why should she have been
so frightened by the fluttering figure seen—for
only half a minute, or so—in the garret window of
the old Corner House?</p>

<p>Like the old lady in the fable, she did not believe
in ghosts, but she was very much afraid of them!</p>

<p>“It’s quite ridiculous, I know,” Ruth told herself,
“for a great big thing like me to shake and
shiver over what I positively <i>know</i> is merely imagination.
That was an old skirt—or a bag—or a
cloak—or <i>something</i>, waving there at that window.</p>

<p>“Er—er, that’s just it!” breathed Ruth. “It
was <i>something</i>. And until I find out just what it
is, I shall not be satisfied. Now, I’m going to be
brave, and walk in there to the girls and Mrs. McCall,
and say nothing. But we’ll start cleaning
that garret this very afternoon,” she concluded,
nodding a determined head.</p>

<p>So she ran into the house to find her three sisters
in the dining-room, with such a peculiar air upon
them that Ruth could not fail to be shocked.
“What under the canopy, as Mrs. McCall says, is
the matter with you all!” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Well! I am glad you have come home, Ruth,”
Agnes began, impulsively. “The most mysterious
things happen around this house——”</p>

<p>“Hush!” commanded Ruth. “What is it now?
You come up stairs to our room and tell me while
I change my clothes. You little ones stay down
here till sister comes back.”</p>

<p>Agnes had stopped at her warning, and meekly
followed Ruth up stairs. In their room the older
girl turned on her and demanded:</p>

<p>“What did you see, Aggie?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t—it was Tess saw him,” replied Agnes,
quickly.</p>

<p>“<i>Him?</i>” gasped Ruth.</p>

<p>“Yes. Of course, it’s foolish. But so many
strange things happen in this old house. First,
you know, what Eva Larry told me about the
ghost——”</p>

<p>“Sh! you haven’t seen it?”</p>

<p>“The ghost!” squealed Agnes. “I should hope
not. If I had——”</p>

<p>She signified by her look and manner that such
an apparition would have quite overcome her.</p>

<p>“It was Tess,” she said.</p>

<p>“She hasn’t been to the garret?”</p>

<p>“Of course not! You believe in that old ghost,
after all, Ruth.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense!”</p>

<p>“Well, if it wasn’t a ghost Tess saw, it was
something like it. The child is convinced. And
coming on top of those vanishing kittens——”</p>

<p>“For mercy’s sake, Aggie Kenway!” screamed
Ruth, grabbing her by the shoulders and giving
Agnes a little shake. “<i>Do</i> be more lucid.”</p>

<p>“Why—ee! I guess I haven’t told you much,”
laughed Agnes. “It was Tess who looked out of
the kitchen window a little while ago and saw
Tommy Rooney going by the house—on Willow
Street.”</p>

<p>“Tommy Rooney?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Tess declares it was. And she’s not
imaginative like Dot, you know.”</p>

<p>“Not Tommy Rooney, from Bloomingsburg?”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any other Tommy Rooney that we
know,” said Agnes, quite calm now. “And if <i>that</i>
doesn’t make a string of uncanny happenings, I
don’t know what <i>would</i>. First the ghost in the
garret——”</p>

<p>“But—but you haven’t seen that?” interrupted
Ruth, faintly.</p>

<p>“No, thank goodness! But it’s <i>there</i>. And
then the vanishing kittens——”</p>

<p>“Has Spotty gone?”</p>

<p>“No. But Sandy-face has, and has been gone
ever since you went out, Ruth. I don’t think much
of that mother cat. She doesn’t stay at home with
her family hardly at all.</p>

<p>“Then this boy who looks like Tommy Rooney,”
concluded Agnes. “For of course it can’t really
<i>be</i> Tommy any more than it can be his spirit.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you have some sense, Ag,” said
Ruth, with a sigh. “Now let’s go down to the
other girls, or they will think we’re hiding something
from them.”</p>

<p>Ruth carried down stairs in her hand the envelope
Mr. Howbridge had given to her. The sisters
gathered in the dining-room, and Agnes
picked up Spotty to comfort him while his mother
was absent. “Poor ’ittle s’ing!” she cooed over
the funny little kitten. “He don’t know wedder
him’s got any mudder, or not.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said Dot, gravely, “that Sandy-face
must be hunting for her lost children.
She wouldn’t really neglect this poor little Spotty
for any other reason—would she?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” Ruth said, briskly. “Now,
girls, look here. Mr. Howbridge says we may
keep Uncle Rufus, and he will pay him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goody!” cried Agnes, clapping her hands.</p>

<p>At once Spotty tumbled off her lap and scurried
under the sofa. He was not used to such actions.</p>

<p>“Now you’ve scared Spotty, I’m afraid,” said
Tess.</p>

<p>“He can get over his scare. What’s that in
your hand, Ruth?” demanded Agnes.</p>

<p>“This is some money Mr. Howbridge gave me
for us to spend. He calls it our monthly allowance.
He says we are to use it just as we please—each
of us.”</p>

<p>“Is some of it mine?” asked Dot.</p>

<p>“Yes, dearie. We’ll see how much he gives you
to spend for your very owniest own, first of
all.”</p>

<p>Ruth tore open the big envelope and shook out
four sealed envelopes of smaller size. She sorted
them and found the one addressed in Mr. Howbridge’s
clerkly hand to “Miss Dorothy Kenway.”</p>

<p>“Now open it, Dot,” urged Tess.</p>

<p>The little girl did so, with sparkling eyes and
the color flushing into her cheeks. From the envelope,
when it was opened, she drew a crisp,
folded dollar bill.</p>

<p>“My!” she murmured. “A whole—new—dollar
bill! My! And can I spend it all, Ruthie?”</p>

<p>“Surely,” said the elder sister, smiling.</p>

<p>“Then I know just what I’m going to do,” said
Dot, nodding her head.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Agnes.</p>

<p>“I’m going to buy some candy on Saturday
that’s not pep’mints. I just <i>am</i>. I’m tired of
Aunt Sarah’s old pep’mint drops.”</p>

<p>The other girls laughed loudly at this decision
of Dot’s. “You funny little thing!” said Ruth.
“Of course you shall buy candy—if you want to.
But I wouldn’t spend the whole dollar for it.
Remember, you’ll get no more spending money until
this time next month.”</p>

<p>“I should hope she’d have sense enough to
kind of spread it out through the month,” said
Agnes. “Hurry up, Ruth. Let’s see what he’s
given the rest of us.”</p>

<p>Tess opened her envelope and found a dollar
and a half. “Oh, I’m <i>rich</i>!” she declared. “I’m
awfully obliged to Mr. Howbridge. I’ll tell him
so when he comes again.” Then she turned
swiftly to Dot and hugged her. “You don’t mind
if I have half a dollar more than <i>you</i> do, Dot?”
she asked. “I’ll divide it with you.”</p>

<p>That was Tess’ way. She could not bear to
think that anybody’s feelings were hurt because of
her. Ruth intervened:</p>

<p>“Dot knows you are two whole years older than
she, Tess. Both of you have more money to spend
than you ever had before, and I am sure neither
will be selfish with it.”</p>

<p>Agnes grabbed her envelope. “I’m just as anxious
to see as I can be,” she confessed.</p>

<p>When she ripped open the envelope she drew
forth two crisp dollar bills. But in Ruth’s there
were five dollars.</p>

<p>“My! it’s a lot of money,” Agnes said. “And
I guess you <i>ought</i> to have more than us—a great
deal more, Ruthie. I’m glad of my two dollars.
I can treat Eva Larry and Myra Stetson. And
I’ll get some new ribbons, and a book I saw in a
window that I want to read. Then, there’s the
prettiest pair of buckles for fifty cents in the shoeshop
window right down Main Street. Did you
see them, Ruth? I want them for my best slippers.
They’ll look scrumptious! And I’d <i>love</i>
to have one of those embroidered handkerchiefs
that they sell at the Lady’s Shop. Besides, it’s
nice to have a little change to rattle in one’s
purse——”</p>

<p>“Mercy!” exclaimed Ruth. “You’ve spent
your allowance twice over, already. And you still
hope to rattle it in your purse! You want to have
your cake, and eat it, too—which is something
that nobody ever managed to accomplish yet, my
dear.”</p>

<p>It was really wonderful for them all to have
money of their own that need not be accounted for.
They came to the luncheon table with very bright
faces, despite the stormy day. They did not say
anything, before Aunt Sarah, about the allowance
Mr. Howbridge had given them. Ruth was
afraid that Aunt Sarah might feel hurt about it.</p>

<p>“She <i>is</i> so touchy,” she said to the others,
“about Uncle Peter’s money. And she ought to
know that she is just as welcome to her share as
she can be!”</p>

<p>“I expect,” the thoughtful Tess said, “that
Aunt Sarah would have enjoyed giving to us just
as much as we enjoy giving to her. Maybe <i>that’s</i>
what’s the matter with her.”</p>

<p>Perhaps that was partly Aunt Sarah’s trouble.
However, there were other topics of conversation
to keep their tongues busy, if the money was
tabooed. Tess could not keep from talking about
Tommy Rooney.</p>

<p>“I <i>know</i> it was Tommy I saw,” she declared.</p>

<p>“But how could Tommy get here, clear from
Bloomingsburg?” Ruth said. “You know how
long it took us to get here by train.”</p>

<p>“I know, Sister,” Tess said. “But it <i>was</i>
Tommy. And he must have had an awfully hard
time.”</p>

<p>“Do—do you s’pose he is looking for us?”
queried Dot.</p>

<p>“Don’t you fret, Dot,” assured Agnes. “He
sha’n’t jump out and say ‘Boo!’ at you any more.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that. I guess the dark scared me more
than Tommy did,” confessed Dot. “But say,
Tess! Did he have his Indian suit on when he
went by in the rain?”</p>

<p>“No. Just rags,” declared Tess.</p>

<p>After luncheon Ruth rummaged for brooms,
brushes and dustcloths. Mrs. McCall asked:</p>

<p>“What under the canopy are you girls going to
do now?”</p>

<p>“Garret. Going to clean it,” said Agnes.</p>

<p>“You’re never going up in that garret in a
storm?” demanded the widow, with a strange look
on her face.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Agnes, eagerly.</p>

<p>“What do you want to bother with it for?” the
good lady asked Ruth without making Agnes any
reply.</p>

<p>“So we can play there on just such days as
this,” said Ruth, firmly. “It will make a splendid
playroom.”</p>

<p>“Well! I wouldn’t do it for a farm,” declared
Mrs. McCall, and at once went out of the room, so
that the girls could not ask further questions.
Agnes whispered to Ruth:</p>

<p>“She knows about the ghost, all right!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so silly,” the older girl said. But
her own heart throbbed tumultuously as she led
the procession up the garret stairs a little later.
They could hear the wind whistling around the
house up here. A shutter rattled, and then the
wind gurgled deep in the throat of one of the unused
chimneys.</p>

<p>“Goodness!” gasped Tess. “How many
strange voices the storm has, hasn’t it? Say,
Dot! do you s’pose we’ll find that goat of yours
up here now?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” said the littler girl. “Aggie
and Ruth were talking about something that
sounded like ‘goat’ that night in bed. And they
won’t tell now what it was.”</p>

<p>“You must never play eavesdropper,” said
Ruth, seriously. “It is very unlady-like.”</p>

<p>“Then folks shouldn’t whisper,” declared Dot,
quickly. “Nobody would ever <i>try</i> to listen, if
folks spoke right out loud. You say, yourself,
Ruth, that it’s not polite to whisper.”</p>

<p>They opened the garret door and peered in.
Although it was so dull a day outside, there was
plenty of light up here. The rain beat against
some of the windows and the wind shook and rattled
the sashes.</p>

<p>Ruth’s gaze turned instantly upon the window
at which she believed she had seen the moving
figure from across Willow Street. There was
nothing hanging near that window that could possibly
have shown from without.</p>

<p>She forced herself to go directly to the place.
It was at the right of one of the huge chimneys
and she could make no mistake, she thought, for
it was at the window to the right of this chimney
that she had seen the specter appear not two
hours before!</p>

<p>A large space about this window was cleared.
There was nothing near enough the window that
could have represented the garret ghost. But this
cleared space before the window seemed to have
been made especially for the ghostly capers of the
“haunt.”</p>

<p>Agnes came gingerly over to where Ruth stood.
She whispered in the older girl’s ear:</p>

<p>“S’pose that old ghost should appear, Ruth?
What would you do? You know, Eva said it was
seen only on stormy days.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly, child,” said Ruth, quite angrily.
She was angry as much at herself for “feeling so
shaky inside,” as she was at Agnes.</p>

<p>She bustled about then, and hurried her sisters,
too. They made a good beginning within the next
two hours. Of course, it was <i>only</i> a beginning.
Dust and cobwebs lay thick over all. They could
brush up only the worst of the litter.</p>

<p>“Next clear day,” Ruth declared, “we’ll take
all these old clothes down and hang what we want
to keep on the lines in the yard. Uncle Rufus can
have the rest. Why do you suppose Uncle Peter
kept this old stuff?”</p>

<p>“They say he got so he wouldn’t give away a
pin, at the last,” said Agnes. “And some of these
old things must have belonged to people dead and
gone when Uncle Peter himself was a boy.”</p>

<p>“I expect so,” agreed Ruth.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose is in all these chests and
trunks, Ruthie?” asked Tess.</p>

<p>“Don’t know, honey. But we’ll find out some
day.”</p>

<p>Just then Uncle Rufus’ tones reached them
from the stairway. He called, in his quavering
old voice:</p>

<p>“Missie! An’ you oder chillen. I done got
somet’ing ter tell yo’.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried Agnes, running to open the
door at the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>“I done foun’ out what happen ter dem kittens,
Missie,” said Uncle Rufus. “You-all come ri’
down an’ I’ll show yo’.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink12'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XII—MRS. KRANZ COMES TO CALL</a></h2>

<p>The girls came down from the garret in a hurry,
when they heard this news. Uncle Rufus hobbled
on before to the kitchen. There was Sandy-face
and Spotty in front of the range. They were both
very wet and the old cat was licking the kitten
dry.</p>

<p>“Where—where’s the others?” cried Tess.
“Did you find Almira?”</p>

<p>“I want my Bungle,” declared Dot. “Didn’t
you find my Bungle kitten, Uncle Rufus?”</p>

<p>“Sho, chile! I didn’t say I foun’ dem kittens.
I on’y say I knowed where dey went.”</p>

<p>“Where?” was the chorused demand.</p>

<p>Uncle Rufus rolled his eyes and chuckled deeply.
“Das ol’ cat play a joke on we-uns,” he declared.
“She t’ink she an’ de kittens on’y come yere for
a visit. And so she lug ’em all back to Mars’
Stetson’s store—ya-as’m!”</p>

<p>“Carried them back to the store?” cried Ruth.
“Oh! she couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Ya-as’m. One at a time. In her teef,” said
Uncle Rufus, nodding confidently. “I jes’ kotch
her out on the sidewalk wid dis leetle brack kitten,
marchin’ straight fo’ de store. Dat how she come
go ’way an’ stay so long. Nex’ time you go to
Mars’ Stetson’s, you find dem dere—sho’.”</p>

<p>“But she couldn’t have taken them out of the
woodshed,” cried Agnes.</p>

<p>“Ya-as’m, she did. She git out de winder. A
cat kin squeeze through a moughty small space—so
she kin.”</p>

<p>“Why, you foolish Sandy-face!” exclaimed Dot.
“And we tried to make you feel at home—didn’t
we, Ruthie?”</p>

<p>“Butter her feet,” said Aunt Sarah, who
chanced to be in the kitchen at the moment. “I
told you that before,” and she walked out.</p>

<p>“Goodness! we’ll butter all their feet,” cried
Agnes, “if that will keep them here. Just as soon
as it holds up a little, I’ll run over to Mr. Stetson’s
and see if it is so. The poor old thing! to
carry those kittens so far. But, me-oh-my! cats
haven’t much sense, after all, have they?”</p>

<p>Uncle Rufus was proved right—and that before
supper time. The rain held up, and Agnes scurried
over to the store, bringing back, huddled in a
small covered basket, Popocatepetl, Almira, and
Bungle, who all seemed very glad to rejoin Spotty.
Sandy-face looked absurdly pleased to see them—just
as though she had not carried them back, one
by one, to a hiding place behind the flour barrels
in Mr. Stetson’s store-room!</p>

<p>Agnes insisted upon buttering the mother-cat’s
paws. And to make sure of it, she buttered the
paws of the four kittens as well.</p>

<p>“There,” she said, “when Sandy gets through
lapping all that butter up, she ought to be <i>proud</i>
to stay here, for butter’s forty cents a pound right
now!”</p>

<p>“You extravagant thing,” sighed Ruth, shaking
her head.</p>

<p>“Yes!” cried Agnes. “And it’s so nice to be
extravagant. I declare, Ruth, I feel that I was
just born to be a rich girl. It <i>tickles</i> me to be extravagant.”</p>

<p>Since returning from Mr. Howbridge’s office,
Ruth had evolved a question that she wished to put
to Uncle Rufus. The mystery of the lost will was
ever present in the mind of the oldest of the Corner
House girls, and this query had to do with that
mystery.</p>

<p>“Uncle Rufus,” she asked the old man, after
dinner that evening when he was carefully putting
away the silver and they were alone together in
the dining-room, “Uncle Rufus, do you know
where Uncle Peter used to keep his private papers?”</p>

<p>“Sho’, Missie, he kept dem in de safe in his
study—ya-as’m. Yo’ know dat safe; don’t
yo’?”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Howbridge has the key to that safe,
and to the desk, and all. And there are some
things—quite important things—that he can’t find.
Didn’t Uncle Peter have some other hiding
place?”</p>

<p>“Glo-ree, Missie! I ’spect he did,” said Uncle
Rufus, rolling his eyes. “But I nebber knowed
whar dat is.”</p>

<p>“And you lived right here with him all those
years?”</p>

<p>“Why, Missie, I tell yo’ how it was,” said Uncle
Rufus, dropping his voice. “Yo’ see, latterly,
Mars’ Peter got pecool’ar—ya-as’m. Yo’ might
call it pecool’ar. I knowed he was superstitious
of folks—ya-as’m. He used ter send me out on
errands—plumb foolish errands, Missie; den I
reckon he hid t’ings away. But I don’ know
whar.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t the least suspicion?” asked Ruth,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Well now!” said Uncle Rufus, rubbing the
bald spot on his head as though to stir his wits
into action. “Dar was dat time he got mad at
me.”</p>

<p>“What about?”</p>

<p>“I warn’t gone so long on an errand, lak’ he
’spected me ter be, I reckon. An’ w’en I come
back he warn’t in his room, an’ dere he was a-comin’
down from de garret with a lighted candle.”</p>

<p>“From the garret?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Missie. An’ he sho’ was mad with ol’
Unc’ Rufus.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he hid papers, then, in one of those
chests, or bureaus up there?”</p>

<p>“Cyan’t say, Missie. Mebbe. But yo’ don’
ketch Unc’ Rufus goin’ up dem garret stairs much—no’m!”</p>

<p>“Why not, Uncle Rufus?” asked Ruth, quickly.
“Are you afraid of the garret ghost?”</p>

<p>“Glo-ree! who done tell yo’ erbout <i>dat</i>?” demanded
the colored man, rolling his eyes again.
“Don’ talk erbout ghos’es; it’s sho’ baid luck.”</p>

<p>That was all Ruth could get out of the old negro.
He had all the fear of his race for supernatural
things.</p>

<p>It was the next day that Mrs. Kranz came to
call. The Corner House girls had never seen Mrs.
Kranz before, but they never could forget her
after their first view of her!</p>

<p>She was a huge lady, in a purple dress, and with
a sweeping gray plume on her big hat, and lavender
gloves. She had the misfortune to possess a
hair-mole on one of her cheeks, and Dot could not
keep her eyes off of that blemish, although she
knew it was impolite to stare.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kranz came to the front door of the old
Corner House and gave a resounding summons on
the big, brass knocker that decorated the middle
panel. Nobody had ventured to approach that
door, save Mr. Howbridge, since the Corner House
girls had come to Milton.</p>

<p>“Goodness! who can that be?” demanded Agnes,
when the reverberations of the knocker echoed
through the big hall.</p>

<p>“Company! I know it’s company!” cried Tess,
running to peer out of the dining-room window.</p>

<p>Ruth gave a glance about the big room, which
they still made their sitting room in general, and
approached the hall. Dot whispered:</p>

<p>“Oh-ee! I hope there are some little girls coming
to call.”</p>

<p>There was nobody but this huge lady, though
half a dozen little girls might have hidden behind
her voluminous skirts. Ruth smiled upon the
giantess and said, quickly, “Good-morning!”</p>

<p>“Vell!” was the deep-throated reply—almost a
grunt. “Vell! iss de family home?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Ruth, in her politest way.
“Do come in. We are all at home,” and she ushered
the visitor into the dining-room.</p>

<p>The lady stared hard at all the girls, and then
around at the old-fashioned furniture; at the plate
rail of Delft china which Ruth had taken out of
a cupboard, where it had been hidden away for
years; at the ancient cellarette; and at the few
pieces of heavy plate with which the highboy and
the lowboy were both decorated.</p>

<p>“Vell!” exclaimed the visitor, in that exceedingly
heavy voice of hers, and for the third time.
“I hear dere iss only madchens—girls—in dis
house. Iss dot so—heh?”</p>

<p>“We are the four Kenway girls,” said Ruth,
pleasantly. “We have no mother or father. But
Aunt Sarah——”</p>

<p>“But you own dis house undt all de odder houses
vot belonged to dot cr-r-ra-zy old mans—heh?”</p>

<p>Ruth flushed a little. She had begun to feel
that such references to Uncle Peter were both unkind
and insulting. “Uncle Peter left his property
by will to us,” she said.</p>

<p>“Vell, I am Mrs. Kranz,” said the large lady,
her little eyes sparkling in rather a strange way,
Ruth thought.</p>

<p>“We are very glad to meet you—to have you
call, Mrs. Kranz,” Ruth said. “Not many of our
neighbors have been in to see us as yet.”</p>

<p>“I aind’t von of de neighbors, Miss Kenway,”
said the visitor. “I am choose Mrs. Kranz. I
keeps de grocery store on Meadow Street yet.”</p>

<p>“We are just as glad to see you, Mrs. Kranz,”
returned Ruth, still smiling, “although you do not
live very near us,” for she knew that Meadow
Street was at the other side of the town.</p>

<p>“Vell! maype nodt,” said Mrs. Kranz. “Maype
you iss nodt so glad to see me yet. I gome to tell
you dot I vill nodt stand for dot Joe Maroni no
longer. He has got to get dot cellar oudt. His
r-r-rotten vegetables smells in mine nostrils. His
young vuns iss in my vay—undt dey steal. An’
dey are all very, very dirty.</p>

<p>“I keep a nice shop—eferbody vill tell you so,
Miss Kenway. Idt iss a clean shop, and them
<i>Eye</i>-talians dey iss like pigs yet—de vay dey lif!”
cried Mrs. Kranz, excitedly. “I pay mine rent,
undt I haf mine rights. I gome to tell you—so-o!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” breathed Ruth, in surprise.
“I—I don’t know what you are talking about, Mrs.
Kranz. Have—have <i>we</i> got anything to do with
your trouble?”</p>

<p>“Vell!” exclaimed the large lady. “Hafn’t
you say you own de house?”</p>

<p>“So Mr. Howbridge says. We own this
house——”</p>

<p>“Undt <i>mine</i> house,” declared Mrs. Kranz.
“Undt more houses. Your uncle, Herr Stower,
own idt. I pay mine rent to him for ten year
yet.”</p>

<p>Ruth began to see—and so did Agnes. Of
course, the little girls only stared and wondered at
the woman’s coarse voice and strange appearance.</p>

<p>“You were one of uncle’s tenants?” said Ruth,
quickly.</p>

<p>“For ten year,” repeated Mrs. Kranz.</p>

<p>“And you are having trouble with another tenant?”</p>

<p>“Mit dot Joe Maroni. He has kinder like steps—von,
two, tri, fo’, five, six—like <i>dot</i>,” and the
woman indicated by gestures the height of the
children in rotation. “Dey swarm all ofer de
blace. I cannot stand dem—undt de dirt—Ach!
idt iss terrible.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Mrs. Kranz,” Ruth said, quietly.
“I understand that this Italian family are likewise
tenants of the house?”</p>

<p>“They lif de cellar in—undt sell vegetables,
undt coal, undt wood, undt ice—undt dirt! heafens,
vot dirt!” and the plume on Mrs. Kranz’s hat
trembled throughout its length, while her red face
grew redder, and her eyes more sparkling.</p>

<p>“But perhaps, Mrs. Kranz, the poor things
know no better,” Ruth suggested. “It must be
dreadful to have to live in a cellar. They have
nobody to teach them. Don’t the children go to
school—when there is school, I mean?”</p>

<p>“Undt I—am <i>I</i> no example to dem yet?” demanded
the lady. “Ach! dese foreigners! I
nefer could get along yet mit foreigners.”</p>

<p>This tickled Agnes so that she laughed, and then
coughed to hide it. Mrs. Kranz was attracted to
the twelve year old.</p>

<p>“Dot iss a pretty madchen,” she said, smiling
broadly upon Agnes. “She iss your sister, too?
Undt de kinder?” her sharp eyes sighting Tess
and Dot.</p>

<p>“This is Agnes,” Ruth said, gladly changing
the subject for a moment. “And this is Tess, and
<i>this</i>, Dot—Dorothy, you know. We have had no
mother for more than two years.”</p>

<p>“Ach!” said Mrs. Kranz, in a tone denoting
sympathy, and she made a funny clucking noise
in her throat. “De poor kinder! Undt <i>you</i> haf
de hausmutter been—no?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Ruth. “I have <i>loved</i> to take
care of the little ones. Agnes is a great help.
And now, since we have come here to the old Corner
House, we have Mrs. McCall and Uncle
Rufus. Besides, there has always been Aunt
Sarah.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Kranz’s big face looked rather blank, but
in a moment her thought returned to the subject
of her visit.</p>

<p>“Vell!” she said. “Undt vot about dot Joe
Maroni?”</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Kranz,” Ruth said, “I do not know
anything about the property Uncle Peter left, as
yet. I shall speak to Mr. Howbridge about it.
He is our guardian, you understand, and a lawyer.
I am sure we can find some way of relieving you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Kranz grunted: “Vell!”</p>

<p>“I shall come to see you,” promised Ruth.
“And I shall see these Italians and try to get
them to clean up their cellar. I am sorry you
should be so troubled by them.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile she had whispered to Tess and sent
her running to Mrs. McCall. Mrs. Kranz gradually
lost her offended look. She even took Dot
upon her broad lap—though that was a precarious
position and Dot was in danger of sliding off all
the time.</p>

<p>“Mine oldt man undt I nefer have no kinder,”
said Mrs. Kranz, sighing windily. “Ve both
vor-r-k—Oh! so hard!—ven young we are. Ven
we marry we are alretty oldt yet. Undt now mine
oldt man iss dead for sefen year, undt I am all
alone.”</p>

<p>Tears came to the good lady’s eyes. Ruth, seeing
a propitious moment, said a word for Joe
Maroni’s children.</p>

<p>“I should think you would like those Italian
children, Mrs. Kranz. Aren’t they pretty?
’Most always I think they are.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Kranz raised her two hands in a helpless
gesture. “Ach! heafens! if dey vos clean yet I
could lofe dem!” she declared.</p>

<p>Just then Uncle Rufus, in his official coat and
spats and white vest, arrived with the tray. It
was evident that Mrs. Kranz was immensely impressed
by the presence of the old serving man.
She accepted a cup of coffee and a piece of cake,
and nibbled the one and sipped the other amidst
a running fire of comment upon the late Mr.
Stower, and his death, and the affairs of the tenements
and stores Uncle Peter had owned in her
neighborhood.</p>

<p>Ruth learned much about this property that she
had never heard before. Uncle Peter had once
collected his own rents—indeed, it was during only
the last few years of his life that a clerk from
Mr. Howbridge’s office had done the collecting.</p>

<p>Uncle Peter had been in touch with his tenants.
He had been a hard man to get repairs out of, so
Mrs. Kranz said, but he had always treated the
good tenants justly. With a record of ten years
of steady rent paying behind her, Mrs. Kranz considered
that she should be recognized and her complaint
attended to. As she could get no satisfaction
from the lawyer’s clerk (for Joe Maroni was
a prompt paying tenant, too), she had determined
to see the owners.</p>

<p>These were the facts leading to the good lady’s
visit. Before she went away again Mrs. Kranz
was much pacified, and openly an admirer of the
Corner House girls.</p>

<p>“Ach! if I had madchens like you of my own
yet!” she said, as she descended the porch steps,
on her departure.</p>

<p>Agnes gazed after her more seriously than was
her wont. She did not even laugh at Mrs. Kranz,
as Ruth expected.</p>

<p>“And I believe she’s an old dear at that,” Ruth
said, reflectively. “Maybe we can get her to help
those little Italian children—if we can once get
their parents to clean them up.”</p>

<p>“Well!” breathed Agnes, finally. “I wasn’t
thinking particularly about her—or of the Joe
Maroni kids. I was just thinking that perhaps it
is not always so nice to be rich, after all. Now!
we didn’t have to worry about tenement house
property, and the quarrels of the tenants, when we
lived on Essex Street in Bloomingsburg.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink13'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XIII—THE MARONIS</a></h2>

<p>It was on this day, too, that Agnes received a
letter from Bloomingsburg. Kitty Robelle wrote
a long and “newsy” letter, for Kitty had been one
of Agnes’ most cherished friends.</p>

<p>Kitty lived right next door to the house in which
the Kenways had lived so long, so she had all the
news to impart of the old neighborhood. One
item interested the four Corner House girls immensely.</p>

<p>“Little Tommy Rooney has run away and his
mother can’t find out what’s become of him. He
swapped his Indian suit with Patsy Link for a
cowboy suit, and has been gone a week. The police,
even, can’t find him.”</p>

<p>“There now!” cried Tess. “What did I tell
you? I <i>knew</i> I saw him go past here in the rain.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but, Tess,” said Ruth, “you can’t be
sure. And how could he ever have gotten to Milton?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the confident Tess. “But
he’s here.”</p>

<p>Dot agreed with her. “You know,” the latter
said, gravely, “he said he was coming to Milton
to shoot Indians.”</p>

<p>“The foolish boy!” exclaimed Ruth. “Indians,
indeed!”</p>

<p>“Did he expect to eat them after he shot
them?” demanded Agnes. “How would he live?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s hungry, poor boy,” said Ruth.
“I wish you girls had run after him that day—if
it was Tommy.”</p>

<p>“He looked awfully ragged,” said Tess, with
pity. “Boys must be a <i>naw</i>ful burden. Isn’t it
lucky we haven’t any brothers to look after,
Ruth?”</p>

<p>“Very fortunate, I think,” agreed the oldest
Kenway.</p>

<p>“Well,” sighed Dot, “Tommy was a real bad
boy, but Mrs. Rooney thinks just as much of him,
I s’pose, as though he was a girl.”</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of it,” chuckled Agnes. “And if
we find Tommy, we’ll send him home to her.”</p>

<p>Having made a promise to Mrs. Kranz, Ruth
was not the girl to neglect its fulfillment. She was
doubtful, however, whether or no she should first
see Mr. Howbridge.</p>

<p>The lawyer was a busy man; perhaps he would
not thank her for bringing such complaints as this
of the grocery store-keeper to his attention. Agnes
said:</p>

<p>“He’s got troubles of his own, you may be sure,
Ruth. And, honest—I don’t see as Mrs. Kranz
has any business to bring her complaints to us.”</p>

<p>“But I said I’d see what I could do.”</p>

<p>“Of course. And I’ll go with you. I’m
awfully eager to see this Joe Maroni and his family—especially
the ‘kinder like steps,’ as Mrs. Kranz
says.”</p>

<p>Ruth agreed to let only Aggie go with her after
the younger girl had given her word not to laugh.
“It is nice to have a sense of humor, I guess,
Ag,” said the older girl, “but you want to have
tact with it. Don’t hurt people’s feelings by
laughing at them.”</p>

<p>“I know,” sighed Agnes. “But Mrs. Kranz
was so funny! To hear her say she did not like
foreigners, when she can scarcely speak English
herself.”</p>

<p>“You might be a foreigner yourself, Ag, as far
as speaking correctly goes,” laughed Ruth.
“You’re awfully slangy. And Mrs. Kranz has
lived in this country for many, many years. She
happens to be one of those unfortunate Germans
who can never master English. But I know she
has a kind heart.“</p>

<p>“She’s dead sore on Joe Maroni and his tribe,
just the same,” declared Agnes, proving the truth
of her sister’s accusation as to her slanginess.</p>

<p>The two older Kenways walked the next afternoon
across town to Meadow Street. It was in
the poorer section of Milton, near the silk mills.
Although the houses were not so tall, and were
mostly frame buildings, the street reminded Ruth
and Agnes of Essex Street, in Bloomingsburg,
where they had resided before coming to the old
Corner House.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kranz had given them her number; and it
was not hard to find the three-story, brick-front
building in which she kept store. Mrs. Kranz
hired the entire street floor, living in rooms at the
back. There were tenements above, with a narrow
hall and stairway leading to them at one side.
The cellar was divided, half being used by Mrs.
Kranz for a store-room.</p>

<p>The other half was the dwelling and store of
the Italian, Joe Maroni, whose name was painted
crookedly on a small sign, and under it his goods
were enumerated as</p>

<p class='center' style='margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;'>ISE COLE WOOD VGERTABLS</p>

<p>Joe himself was in evidence as the girls came to
the place. He was a little, active, curly haired
man, in velveteen clothing and cap, gold rings in
his ears, and a fierce mustache.</p>

<p>“A regular brigand,” whispered Agnes, rather
shrinking from his vicinity and clinging to Ruth’s
hand.</p>

<p>“I’m sure he’s a reformed brigand,” Ruth
laughed.</p>

<p>The girls’ own nostrils informed them that part
of Mrs. Kranz’s complaint must be true, for there
was a tall basket beside the vegetable and fruit
stand into which Joe had thrown decayed vegetable
leaves and fruit. It was a very warm day and
the odor certainly was offensive.</p>

<p>Joe came forward smiling, as the girls stopped
at the stand. “Want-a da orange—da pear—da
banan’?” he asked, in a most agreeable way.
Agnes immediately reversed her opinion and declared
he was actually <i>handsome</i>.</p>

<p>“Nice-a vegetables,” said Joe, eager to display
his wares. “All fre-esh.”</p>

<p>Ruth took her courage in both hands and smiled
at him in return. “We haven’t come to buy anything
this afternoon, Mr. Maroni,” she said.
“You see, our Uncle Peter gave us this house when
he died. Our name is Kenway. We have come
to see you——”</p>

<p>“Si! Si!” cried the Italian, understanding them
at once. “You da litla Padrona wot own all
dese,” with a wave of his hand that was both
graceful and explanatory. “Me, Joe, me hear-a
’bout de litla Padrona. Grazias!” and he bowed
and lifted his cap.</p>

<p>The children had appeared from the cool depths
of the cellar as if by magic. They <i>were</i> like a
flight of steps in height, and the oldest was a very
pretty girl, possibly as old as Agnes, but much
smaller. Joe turned swiftly to this one and said
something in his own tongue, nothing of which did
the visitors understand save the child’s name,
“Maria.”</p>

<p>Maria darted down the steps again, and immediately
Joe fished out a basket from under the
stand and proceeded to fill it with his very choicest
fruit.</p>

<p>“For you, Padrona,” he explained, bowing to
Ruth again. “You mak-a me ver’ hap’ to come
see me. Grazias!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but Mr. Maroni!” cried Ruth, rather nervously.
“You must not give us all that nice fruit.
And we did not come just to call. Some—some of
the other tenants have complained about you.”</p>

<p>The man looked puzzled, and then troubled.
“What is that ‘complain’?” he asked. “They no
lik-a me? They no lik-a my wife? They no lik-a
my chil’ren?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! nothing like that,” Ruth said, sympathetically.
“They only say you do not keep the
stand clean. See! that basket of rotting vegetables
and fruit. You should get rid of it at once.
Don’t the collectors come through this part of the
town for garbage?”</p>

<p>“Si! Si!” cried Joe, shrugging his shoulders.
“But sometimes come first my poor compatriots—si?
They find da orange with da speck; dey
fin’ potato part good-a—see?” All the time he
was showing them the specked vegetables and
fruit in the basket. Although his hands were
grimed, Ruth noticed that he was otherwise clean.
The children, though dirty and ragged, were really
beautiful.</p>

<p>“W’en da poor peep’ go, then I put out-a da
basket for da cart,” pursued Joe, still smiling and
still gesturing.</p>

<p>Up the steps at that moment came a smiling,
broad Italian woman, with a gay clean bandanna
over her glossy black hair. She was a pretty
woman, too, with the same features as little Maria.</p>

<p>“Good-a day! good-a day!” she said, bobbing
and courtesying. Then she added something in
Italian which was a friendly greeting.</p>

<p>Joe smiled on her dazzlingly. She wore heavier
earrings than Joe and a great gilt brooch to hold
the neck of her gown together.</p>

<p>“She no spe’k da English mooch,” explained
the man. “But da keeds——Oh! dey learn to
spe’k fine in da school. We been in dis country
six year—no? We come here fi’ year ago. We
doin’ fine!” explained Joe, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Agnes was already hugging one of the toddlers,
and trying to find a clean spot on his pretty face
that she could kiss. “Aren’t they little darlings?”
she said to Ruth.</p>

<p>The older girl agreed with her, but she was having
difficulty herself in forming the request she
wished to make to the Italian. Finally she said:</p>

<p>“Joe, you must let the city men take away your
spoiled fruit every morning. You can pick it over
yourself and save what you think your poor
friends would like. Although, it is very bad to
eat decayed fruit and vegetables. Bad for the
health, you know.”</p>

<p>“Si! Si!” exclaimed Joe, smiling right along.
“I understand. It shall be as da litla Padrona
command. Eh?”</p>

<p>“And let me go down into the cellar, Joe. For
your own sake—for your children’s health, you
know—you must keep everything clean.”</p>

<p>The woman spoke quickly and with energy. Joe
nodded a great deal. “Si! Si!” he said. “So
the good-a doctor say wot come to see da bébé.”</p>

<p>“Oh! have you a baby?” cried Agnes, clasping
her hands.</p>

<p>The woman smiled at the eager girl and offered
her hand to lead Agnes down the broken steps.
Ruth followed them. The cellar was damp because
of the ice blocks covered with a horseblanket
at one side. Beyond the first partition, in a darker
room, there was an old bedstead with ugly looking
comforters and pillows without cases. Right
down in one corner was an old wooden cradle with
the prettiest little black haired baby in the world
sleeping in it! At least, so Agnes declared.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maroni was delighted with the girls’ evident
admiration for the baby. She could tell them
by signs and broken words, too, that the baby was
now better and the doctor had told her to take it
out into the air and sunshine all day. She could
trust some of the older children with it; Maria
was big enough to help at the stand. <i>She</i> had the
housework to do.</p>

<p>The Italian woman led the way to her other
apartment—if such it could be called. The rear
cellar had two little, high windows looking into
a dim little yard. They had no right to the yard.
That belonged to the tenants above, and Ruth
could see very well that the yard would be the better
for a thorough cleaning-up.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Mr. Howbridge will say we have no
right to interfere,” thought the oldest of the Corner
House girls. “But I’m just going to tell him
what I think of this place.”</p>

<p>The cellar was not so dirty, only it was <i>messy</i>.
The Italians’ possessions were of the cheapest
quality, and they had scarcely a decent chair to
sit on. Whether it was poverty or a lack of
knowledge of better things, Ruth could not decide.</p>

<p>The little Maria came close to her side and
smiled at her. “You speak English all right,
don’t you?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Ma’am. I go to school,” said Maria.</p>

<p>“Do you know the lady who has the store up
stairs?”</p>

<p>The little girl’s face clouded. “Yes, Ma’am.
I guess she’s a nice German lady, but she is <i>so</i>
cross.”</p>

<p>“I do not think she’d be cross with you if she
saw you in a clean dress and with your face and
hands washed,” said Ruth, with a sudden idea.
“If you will make yourself tidy, I will take you up
stairs with me, and we can call on Mrs. Kranz.”</p>

<p>The child’s face brightened in a flash. She said
something to her mother, who replied in kind.
Maria ran behind a curtain that hung in one
corner, and just then Joe came down.</p>

<p>“You want-a me to feex up, Padrona?” he
asked. “I no ask nottin’ since w’en I come here.
De walls much dirt’—eh?”</p>

<p>“If they were whitewashed I think it would be
ever so nice and clean,” declared Ruth. “I shall
speak to Mr. Howbridge and see if I can get him
to supply the whitewash. Will you put it on?”</p>

<p>“But surely—si! si!” exclaimed the man. “I
lik-a have nice place. I keep good-a fruit—good-a
vegetable. Da wife, she clean an’ scr-r-rub—oh,
yes! But poor man live in da cellar not lik-a da
reech dat live in da fine house.”</p>

<p>Ruth sighed. With such little experience as she
had had, she knew the man’s words to be true.
The Kenways had lived among poor people themselves
and knew how hard it was to keep an old
tumble-down tenement in nice order.</p>

<p>Maria came dancing out in what was evidently
her gala frock. It was pretty and neatly made,
too. She ran to the sink and washed her face and
hands. Then she came to Ruth for her approval.</p>

<p>“You’re a pretty girl,” said Ruth, kissing her.
“You can help a lot, too, by keeping your brothers
and sisters clean.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Ma’am! I make them wash up every
day before they go to school. But there is no
school now,” said Maria.</p>

<p>The visitors went out of the cellar with Maria.
The other children eyed them curiously, but smilingly.
Poverty set well upon these Italians, for
they smiled at it!</p>

<p>“Now we shall go in and see Mrs. Kranz,” said
Ruth to Agnes. “Goodness only knows what she
will say to us. Come, Maria,” and she took the
little girl’s hand.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink14'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XIV—FIVE CENTS’ WORTH OF PEPPERMINTS</a></h2>

<p>“Vell! vell!” was the German lady’s greeting
when the girls entered the shop. “You gome
quick back to see me already, eh? I am glad.”</p>

<p>She came forward and kissed Agnes and then
Ruth. But she halted as she was about to stoop
to Maria.</p>

<p>“Ach! this is nefer von of de kinder I saw yesterday?”
she cried.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know this little girl, Mrs. Kranz?”
asked Ruth, smiling. “This is Maria Maroni.”</p>

<p>“Ach! I nefer did!” exclaimed Mrs. Kranz,
using an expression that she must have picked up
from her American neighbors. “Vell! I lofe <i>clean</i>
kinder,” and she delivered a resounding kiss upon
Maria’s darkly flushed cheek. “Undt how pretty
she iss.”</p>

<p>“I am sure she is quite as good as she is pretty,”
said Ruth, smiling. “You ought to have just such
a little girl as Maria to help you, Mrs. Kranz.”</p>

<p>“Ach! I would lofe to have such a girl,” declared
the good lady. “Come you all right back
to mine poller. Iky! ’tend to the store yet,” she
shouted to a lanky youth lounging on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“He vill eat up all mine dried apples, yet, undt
trink soda-pop, if I don’t vatch him. Some day
dot Iky iss goin’ to svell right up undt bust! But
he lifs up stairs undt his mutter iss a hard vorkin’
vidow.”</p>

<p>“As though <i>that</i> excused Iky for stuffing himself
with dried apples,” whispered Agnes to Ruth.
Ruth looked at her admonishingly and Agnes subsided.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kranz bustled about to put coffee-cake and
other toothsome dainties, beside bottles of lemon-soda,
before the three visitors. She treated Maria
just as nicely as she did Ruth and Agnes. Ruth
had not been mistaken in her judgment of Mrs.
Kranz. She <i>had</i> to own such a big body to hold
her heart!</p>

<p>Ruth told her how they had talked with Maroni
and how he had agreed to clean up the cellar, and
get rid of the decayed vegetables daily. But it
was, without doubt, Maria’s improved appearance,
more than anything else, that thawed the good
lady.</p>

<p>“Ach! it iss de way de vorld iss made,” sighed
Mrs. Kranz. “That Joe Maroni, he hass six
kinder; I haf none. This mädchen, she shall help
me in de house, undt in de store. I buy her plenty
clean dresses. I’ll talk to that Joe. Ven I am
madt mit him I can’t talk, for he smile, an’
smile——Ach! how can I fight mit a man dot smiles
all de time?”</p>

<p>The two older Kenway girls started home
feeling that they had accomplished something worth
while at the Meadow Street tenement house.
“Only,” said Ruth, “if we really had the right
to do so, I can see that there are a lot of repairs
that would make the house more comfortable for
the tenants.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose if Uncle Peter had thought of
the comfort of the tenants, he would never have
made so much money out of the houses,” observed
Agnes, with more thought than she usually displayed.</p>

<p>Just then Joe and Maria came hurrying down
the block after them. “No, Padrona!” cried the
man. “You would not r-r-refuse Joe’s poor litla
present? Maria shall carry eet for you—si! si!
She is a smart girl—no? She fin’ her way all over
town.”</p>

<p>They thanked Maroni for the basket of fruit,
and allowed Maria to carry it to the Corner House,
for that gave her pleasure, too, Ruth could see.</p>

<p>It gave them an opportunity of introducing
Maria Maroni to Tess and Dot. The younger
Kenways were very glad to see her, and Maria
was made acquainted with the garden playhouse
and with the rows of dolls.</p>

<p>“I don’t care so much because the Creamer girls
won’t play with us,” said Tess, happily, after
Maria had run home. “Alfredia and Maria are
both very nice little girls.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Dot, quickly. But she
added, after a moment: “And they can’t either
of them help being so awful dark complected!”</p>

<p>It had begun to bother Ruth, however, if it did
none of the other three, that so few people called
on them. Of course, the Kenways had not been
in Milton but four weeks. The people they met at
church, however, and the girls they had become
acquainted with at Sunday School, had not called
upon them.</p>

<p>Eva Larry was delighted to see Agnes on the
street, and had taken her home one day with her.
Myra Stetson was always jolly and pleasant, but
no urging by Agnes could get either of these nice
girls to visit the old Corner House.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose it is the ghost of the garret
that keeps them away?” demanded Agnes, of
Ruth.</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t entertain them in the garret,”
responded Ruth, laughing. Only she did not feel
like laughing. “If that is the trouble, however,
we’ll soon finish up cleaning out the garret. And
we’ll sweep out the ghost and all his tribe, too.”</p>

<p>A Saturday intervened before this could be accomplished,
however. It was the first Saturday
after Mr. Howbridge had bestowed upon the
Corner House girls their monthly allowance.</p>

<p>After the house was spick and span, and the
children’s playthings put away for over Sunday,
and the garden (which was now a trim and promising
plot) made particularly neat, the four girls
dressed in their very best and sallied forth. It
was after mid-afternoon and the shoppers along
Main Street were plentiful.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah never went out except to church on
Sunday. Now that the weather was so warm, the
big front door stood open a part of the time, and
the girls sat with their sewing and books upon the
wide porch. Mrs. McCall joined them there; but
Aunt Sarah, never.</p>

<p>Because she did not go out, anything Aunt Sarah
needed was purchased by one of the girls. Particularly,
Ruth never forgot the peppermints which
were bought as regularly now that they lived in
the Corner House as they were bought in the old
days, back in Bloomingsburg.</p>

<p>Sometimes Ruth delegated one of the other girls
to buy the peppermints, but on this particular occasion
she chanced to find herself near the candy
counter, when she was separated from Agnes in
Blachstein &amp; Mapes. So she purchased the usual
five cents’ worth of Aunt Sarah’s favorite Sunday
“comfort.”</p>

<p>“No matter how dry the sermon is, or how long-winded
the preacher, I can stand it, if I’ve got a
pep’mint to chew on,” the strange old lady once
said. That was almost as long a sentence as the
girls had ever heard her speak!</p>

<p>With the peppermints safe in her bag, Ruth
hunted again for Agnes. But the latter had those
shoe-buckles on her mind and, forgetting Ruth, she
left the big store and made for the shoeshop.</p>

<p>On the way Agnes passed the Lady’s Shop with
its tempting display in the show-window, and she
ventured in. There were those lovely handkerchiefs!
Agnes feasted her eyes but she could not
gain the courage to break one of her dollar bills
for the trifle.</p>

<p>So she wandered out and went toward the glittering
buckles in the shoeshop window. And
there she hesitated again. Fifty cents! A
quarter of her entire monthly allowance. She
wanted to find Eva Larry, who would be down
town, too, and treat her to a sundae. Besides, she
must buy Myra Stetson some little remembrance.</p>

<p>“I know what I’ll do!” thought Agnes finally,
her eye suddenly lighting upon a candy store
across Main Street. “I can break one of these
bills by getting Aunt Sarah’s peppermints. Then
it won’t seem so hard to spend the change.”</p>

<p>Agnes tripped over the crosswalk and purchased
the little bag of peppermints. These she popped
into her own handbag, and a little later came
across Eva. They went into the drug store on the
corner and had a sundae apiece. Agnes bought
some hairpins (which she certainly could not use)
and a comb, and some lovely ribbon, and a cunning
little red strawberry emery-bag for her sewing-box,
and several other trifles. She found all her
change gone and nothing but the dollar bill left in
her purse. That scared Agnes, and she ran home,
refusing to break the remaining bill, and much
troubled that she should have been so reckless in
her expenditures the very first time she was out.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot had gone together. There was
no reason why two girls, of eight and ten respectively,
should not shop on Milton’s Main Street.
The younger Kenway girls had often shopped for
Ruth, while they lived in Bloomingsburg.</p>

<p>The Five and Ten Cent Store attracted them.
There was a toy department, and all kinds of cheap
fancy goods, and little things for presents. Tess
roamed among these, using her eyes to good advantage,
save that she forgot to look for Dot,
after a time.</p>

<p>There was a very cute little spool holder for ten
cents, and Tess bought that for Mrs. McCall.
Uncle Rufus she remembered in the purchase of a
red and black tie for “state and date” occasions.
She bought a pretty ruching for Ruth’s collar, and
a new thimble for Agnes, because Agnes was always
losing her silver one.</p>

<p>For Dot, Tess bought a tiny doll’s tea-set, and
forgetting herself entirely, Tess wandered out of
the store with her bundles, looking for her sister.
She did not at once see Dot, but a boy was selling
cheap candies from a basket, and Tess was smitten
with the thought that she had forgotten Aunt
Sarah!</p>

<p>She bought a bag of white peppermint drops in
a hurry. That took all of Tess’ half dollar, and
she did not want to break into the bill; so she
went home without satisfying any of her own personal
longings.</p>

<p>Dot had found the candy counter in the big store
the first thing. There were heaps, and heaps of
goodies. Dot possessed a sweet tooth, and she
had never really had enough candy at one time in
her life—not even at Christmas.</p>

<p>Some of this candy was ten cents a pound, and
some ten cents a quarter of a pound. Dot knew
that if she bought the more expensive kind, her
dollar bill would not go far. And she really did
not want to spend all her month’s money just for
candy. Ruth would think her extravagant and
Agnes would laugh at her.</p>

<p>The little girl moved along in front of the
counter, feasting her eyes upon the variegated
sweets. There were chocolates, and bonbons, and
nut candies, and “kisses,” and many candies of
which Dot did not know even the names. Finally
she came to the end, where the cheaper kinds were
displayed.</p>

<p>Dot’s eyes grew round and she uttered a half-stifled
“Oh!” There was a great heap of luscious
looking, fat peppermint drops. They looked to be
so creamy and soft, that Dot was <i>sure</i> they were
far superior to any drops that Aunt Sarah had
ever had in the past.</p>

<p>“Here, little girl,” said the lady behind the
counter, seeing Dot feasting her eyes upon the
heap of peppermints. “Here’s a broken one,”
and she reached over the screen and passed Dot
the crumbly bit of candy.</p>

<p>Dot thanked her nicely and popped the broken
peppermint drop into her mouth. It was every
bit as nice as it looked. It was crumbly, and
creamy, and sweet, with just the right amount of
peppermint essence in it.</p>

<p>“I’ll buy Aunt Sarah’s peppermints my own
self,” decided Dot. Then she hesitated, being an
honest little thing. She knew that she could not
resist the temptation of those luscious drops, once
they were in her hands.</p>

<p>“I’ll take <i>two</i> quarter pounds, if you please,
Ma’am,” she said to the saleslady. “In two bags.
One’s for my Aunt Sarah and the other’s for
Tess and me.”</p>

<p>Having broken her dollar bill for these two bags
of sweets, Dot felt rather frightened, and she, too,
hurried out of the store.</p>

<p>The four Corner House girls arrived home at
about the same time—and not long before the
usual dinner hour. Dot and Tess had tasted out
of the special bag of peppermint drops that Dot
had bought, in the yard. Tess had so many other
things to show her smaller sister that neither suspected
the other’s possession of Aunt Sarah’s peppermints.</p>

<p>Dot ran up to Aunt Sarah’s room as soon as she
got inside the door. “I got your pep’mint drops,
Auntie!” she cried, plumping the bag into the old
lady’s lap.</p>

<p>“Humph! Good child,” declared Aunt Sarah,
and opened the bag invitingly. “Have one?”</p>

<p>“No-o, Ma’am,” said Dot, backing away. “I’ve
been eating some out of <i>my</i> bag,” and she showed
Aunt Sarah her other purchase. “Ruth says it
spoils your appetite to eat too much candy before
dinner.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” remarked Aunt Sarah.</p>

<p>As Dot went down the stairway, Tess came dancing
along from the bathroom, with a fresh ribbon
in her hair and her face and hands still damp.
“Oh, Aunt Sarah!” she cried, “here is your bag
of peppermints for to-morrow,” and she held up
her own purchase. “Shall I put them in your
room on the bureau?”</p>

<p>“Humph!” exclaimed the old lady, stopping
and eyeing Tess curiously. “So <i>you’ve</i> got
them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Ma’am,” said Tess, and hopped down
stairs by the old lady’s side very happily.</p>

<p>There was a neat little box resting on the table
beside Aunt Sarah’s plate. Agnes said:
“There’s your Sunday peppermints, Aunt Sarah.
I got them at the Unique candy store, and I guess
they’re nice ones.”</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah merely glared at her, and remained
speechless. That was nothing strange; the old
lady sometimes acted as though she did not hear
you speak to her at all.</p>

<p>Mrs. McCall came in from the kitchen and Ruth
appeared from up stairs. Uncle Rufus arrived
with the steaming soup tureen. As Ruth sat
down, she said to Aunt Sarah:</p>

<p>“You’ll find your peppermints on the hall stand,
Aunt Sarah. I forgot to bring them up to your
room.”</p>

<p><i>That</i> was too much. The old lady blazed up
like a freshly kindled fire.</p>

<p>“For the good Land o’ Goshen! I got peppermints
enough now to last me four meetings. I believe
getting your Uncle Peter’s money the way
you have, has made all you gals silly!”</p>

<p>She refused to say another word to any of them
that evening.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink15'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XV—“A DISH OF GOSSIP”</a></h2>

<p>The seamstress came on Monday to the old Corner
House. Mrs. McCall had recommended her,
and in Milton Miss Ann Titus was a person of considerable
importance.</p>

<p>She was a maiden lady well past middle age, but,
as she expressed it herself, “more than middling
spry.” She was, as well, a traveling free information
bureau.</p>

<p>“Two things I am fond of, gals,” she said to
Ruth and Agnes, the first day. “A cup of tea,
and a dish of gossip.”</p>

<p>She was frank about the last named article of
mental diet. She knew that most of the people
she worked for enjoyed her gossip as much as
they desired her needle-work.</p>

<p>Ruth had opened and aired a room for her at the
back of the house, and there she was established
with her cutting table and sewing machine. She
would not hear of remaining at night with them.</p>

<p>“I got an old Tom-cat at home that would yowl
his head off, if I didn’t give him his supper, and
his breakfast in the morning. He can forage for
himself at noon.”</p>

<p>She lived in a tiny cottage not far from the old
Corner House—the girls had seen it. She had
lived there most of her life, and she had a tidy
little sum in the savings-bank. Miss Ann Titus
might have lived without working at her trade.</p>

<p>“But I sartain-sure should die of lonesomeness,”
she declared. “A cat’s well enough as far
as he goes; but you can’t call him right inspiritin’
company.”</p>

<p>Ruth went to the big store where Mr. Howbridge
had opened a charge account for her and bought
such goods as Miss Titus wanted. Then the capable
woman went to work to make up several summer
and fall dresses for the four girls.</p>

<p>These were busy times at the old Corner House.
The sewing room was a scene of bustle and hurrying
from morning to night. One or the other of
the girls seemed to be “trying-on” all the time.
Ruth and Agnes, to say nothing of Mrs. McCall,
spent all their spare minutes helping the dressmaker.</p>

<p>“You young-uns have sartain-sure got pluck to
come to this old place to live,” Miss Titus declared
on the second day. The wind was rising, the shutters
shook, and loose casements rattled.</p>

<p>“It’s a very nice house, we think,” said Ruth.</p>

<p>The smaller girls were not present, but Miss
Titus lowered her voice: “Ain’t you none afraid
of what they say’s in the garret?”</p>

<p>“What is in the garret?” asked Ruth, calmly.
“We have cleaned it all up, and have found
nothing more dangerous than old clothes and spiders.
We play up there on rainy days.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t do it for a farm!” gasped Miss
Titus.</p>

<p>“So you believe in that ghost story?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. They say some man, ’way back before
Peter Stower’s father lived, hung himself
up there.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Ruth. “How wicked it is to repeat
such stories.”</p>

<p>“I dunno. I can find you half a dozen good,
honest folks, that have seen the ghost at the garret
window.”</p>

<p>Ruth could not help shivering. She had begun
to refuse to acknowledge the evidence of her own
eyes, and <i>that</i> had helped. But Miss Titus seemed
so positive.</p>

<p>“Is—is it because they are afraid of ghosts, that
so few people have come to call on us, do you suppose?”
Ruth asked.</p>

<p>The seamstress glanced at her through her
spectacles. She had very sharp eyes and she
snipped off threads with a bite of her sharp teeth,
and stuck a sharp needle into her work in a very
sharp manner. Altogether, Miss Ann Titus was
a very sharp person.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if there was another reason,”
she said. “Ain’t the minister’s wife been?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. And we think she is lovely. But not
many of the girls we meet at church have called.
I thought maybe they were afraid. The house has
had a bad name, because it was practically shut up
so long.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Miss Titus. “And Peter Stower
acted funny, too. They say <i>his</i> ghost haunts it.”</p>

<p>“How foolish!” said Ruth, flushing. “If people
don’t want to come because of <i>that</i>——”</p>

<p>“Maybe there <i>is</i> another reason,” said the gossip.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what it is!” demanded Ruth,
determined to learn the worst. And Miss Titus
<i>did</i> look so knowing and mysterious.</p>

<p>“Well, now,” said Miss Titus, biting off another
thread. “Speakin’ for myself, I think you
gals are just about right, and Mr. Howbridge did
the right thing to put you into Peter’s house. But
there’s them that thinks different.”</p>

<p>“What <i>do</i> you mean?” begged the puzzled Ruth.</p>

<p>“There’s been a deal of talk. Mr. Howbridge
is blamed. They say he did it just to keep the
property in his own hands. He must make a good
speck out of it.”</p>

<p>“But you are puzzling me, more and more,”
cried Ruth. “I suppose Mr. Howbridge does not
handle Uncle Peter’s estate for nothing. How
could he?”</p>

<p>“Trust Howbridge for feathering his nest all
right,” said the seamstress, bitingly. “But that
ain’t it. You see, there’s them that believes other
folks than you Kenway gals should have the old
Corner House and all that goes with it!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Ruth. “You do not mean Aunt
Sarah?”</p>

<p>“Sally Maltby?” snapped Miss Titus. “Well,
I should say <i>not</i>. She ain’t got no rights here at
all. Never did have. Never would have, if Peter
had had his way.”</p>

<p>“I am sure <i>that</i> is not so,” began Ruth. Then
she stopped. She realized that Miss Titus would
carry everything she said to her next customer.
She did not know that either Mr. Howbridge, or
Aunt Sarah, would care to have the news bandied
about that Uncle Peter had left Aunt Sarah a
legacy.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re welcome to your own belief,
Ruthie,” said Miss Titus, curiously eyeing her.
“But it ain’t Sally Maltby that folks are talking
about.”</p>

<p>“Who can possibly have any right here?”
queried Ruth. “Mr. Howbridge declares there
are no other heirs.”</p>

<p>“He ain’t heard of ’em—or else he don’t want to
acknowledge ’em,” declared Miss Titus. “But
these folks live at a distance. They’re another
branch of the Stower family, I reckon, and ’tis
said that they’ve got a better right than you gals.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Ruth again.</p>

<p>“That’s why folks don’t come to congratulate
you, I reckon. They ain’t sure that you’ll stay
here long. Maybe them other relatives will come
on, or begin suit in the courts, or something. And
the neighbors don’t like to mix in, or take sides,
until the matter’s straightened out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, me!” sighed Ruth. “We love staying
here at the old Corner House, but we never
wished to take anybody’s rights away from them.
Mr. Howbridge assured us that we were the only
heirs, and that the estate would in time be settled
upon us. It makes me feel very badly—this news
you tell me, Miss Titus.”</p>

<p>“Well! let sleepin’ dogs lie, is <i>my</i> motter,” declared
the seamstress. “You might as well enjoy
what you got, while you got it.”</p>

<p>If Ruth had been troubled before by the circumstances
that had brought her and her sisters to the
old Corner House, she was much more troubled
now. Uncle Peter had made a will, she had been
assured by Mr. Howbridge, which left the bulk of
the old man’s estate to the Kenway girls; but that
will was lost. If other claimants came forward,
how should Ruth and her sisters act toward them?</p>

<p>That was Ruth’s secret trouble. Without the
will to make their own claim good, did not these
other relatives Miss Titus had spoken of have as
good a right to shelter in the old Corner House,
and a share of the money left by Uncle Peter, as
they had?</p>

<p>Ruth could not talk about it with her sisters—not
even with Agnes. The latter would only be
troubled, while Tess and Dot would not understand
the situation very well. And Aunt Sarah was no
person in whom to confide!</p>

<p>Mr. Howbridge had gone away on business
again. She had written him a note to his office
about Joe Maroni and Mrs. Kranz, and Mr. Howbridge
had sent back word—just before his departure
on the sudden trip—that she should use
her own judgment about pacifying the tenants in
the Meadow Street houses.</p>

<p>“You know that every dollar you spend on those
old shacks reduces the revenue from the property.
You girls are the ones interested. Now, let us
test your judgment,” Mr. Howbridge had written.</p>

<p>It put a great responsibility upon Ruth’s
shoulders; but the girl of sixteen had been bearing
responsibilities for some years, and she was not
averse to accepting the lawyer’s test.</p>

<p>“We want to help those Maronis,” she said to
Agnes. “And we want Mrs. Kranz to help them,
too. We’ll just clean up that old house, and that
will help all the families in it.”</p>

<p>She ordered the whitewashing materials, and
Joe promised to whiten his cellar. She hired the
boy, Iky, and another, to clean the yard, too, and
paid them out of her own pocket. Mrs. Kranz
smiled broadly, while the Maronis considered “the
litla Padrona” almost worthy to be their patron
saint!</p>

<p>Ruth had begged Miss Titus to say nothing before
Agnes or the little girls regarding those possible
claimants to Uncle Peter’s property. She was
very sorry Mr. Howbridge had gone away
before she could see him in reference to this gossip
the seamstress had brought to the house.</p>

<p>It seemed that a certain Mrs. Bean, a friend of
Miss Ann Titus, who did not attend the First
Church, but another, knew all about the people
who claimed relationship with Uncle Peter Stower.
Ruth was sorely tempted to call on Mrs. Bean, but
then, she feared she had no business to do so, until
she had talked with the lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. Howbridge had given her a free hand in
many things, but this matter was too important,
it seemed to Ruth, for her to touch without his
permission. With the expectation of other claimants
to the property looming before her, Ruth was
doubtful if she ought to go ahead with the frocks
for her sisters and herself, or to increase their
bills at the stores.</p>

<p>However, their guardian had already approved
of these expenditures, and Ruth tried to satisfy
her conscience by curtailing the number of her own
frocks and changing the engagement of Miss Titus
from three weeks to a fortnight only.</p>

<p>“I must confer with Mr. Howbridge first, before
we go any farther,” the girl thought. “Mercy!
the bills for our living expenses here at the old
Corner House are mounting up enormously.”</p>

<p>Agnes was so delighted over the frocks that were
being made for her, that she thought of little else,
waking, and probably dreamed of them in sleep,
as well! She did not notice Ruth’s gravity and
additional thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>As for Tess and Dot, they had their small heads
quite full of their own affairs. They were having
a better time this summer than ever they had
dreamed of having in all their young lives.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot were not without friends of their
own age to play with, in spite of the fact that the
Creamer girls next door had proved so unpleasant.
There were two girls next door to Mrs. Adams
who were nice, and as Mrs. Adams promised, she
arranged a little tea party for Tess and Dot, and
these other girls, one afternoon. The new friends
were Margaret and Holly Pease.</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams had the tea on her back lawn in the
shade of a big tulip tree. She had just the sort of
cakes girls like best, and strawberries and cream,
and the “cambric tea,” as Mrs. Adams called it,
was rich with cream and sugar. Mrs. Adams herself
took a cup of tea that had brewed much longer;
she said she wanted it “strong enough to bite,”
or it did not give her a mite of comfort.</p>

<p>From where the pleasant little party sat, they
could look over the fence into the big yard belonging
to the Pease place. “Your folks,” said
Mrs. Adams to her next door neighbors, “are going
to have a right smart lot of cherries. That
tree’s hanging full.”</p>

<p>The tree in question was already aflame with the
ripening fruit. Margaret said:</p>

<p>“Mother says we’ll have plenty of cherries to
do up for once—if the birds and the boys don’t
do too much damage. There are two nests of
robins right in that one tree, and they think they
own all the fruit. And the boys!”</p>

<p>“I expect that Sammy Pinkney has been
around,” said Mrs. Adams.</p>

<p>“There’s worse than him,” said Holly Pease,
shaking her flaxen head. “This morning papa
chased an awfully ragged boy out of that tree.
The sun was scarcely up, and if it hadn’t been
for the robins scolding so, papa wouldn’t have
known the boy was there.”</p>

<p>“A robber boy!” cried Mrs. Adams. “I wager
that’s who got my milk. I set a two quart can out
in the shed last night, because it was cool there.
And this morning more than half of the milk was
gone. The little rascal had used the can cover to
drink out of.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Tess, pityingly, “the poor boy must
have been hungry.”</p>

<p>“He’s probably something else by now,” said
Mrs. Adams, grimly. “Half ripe cherries and
milk! My soul and body! Enough to snarl anybody’s
stomach up into a knot, but a boy’s. I
guess boys can eat anything—and recover.”</p>

<p>Holly said, quietly: “There was a boy worked
for Mrs. Hovey yesterday. He was awfully
hungry and ragged. I saw him carrying in wood
from her woodpile. And he just staggered, he
was so small and weak. And his hair looked so
funny——”</p>

<p>“What was the matter with his hair?” asked
her sister.</p>

<p>“It was red. Brick red. I never saw such red
hair before.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Tess. “Did he have sure enough
<i>red</i> hair?” Then she turned to Dot. “Do you
s’pose it could be Tommy Rooney, Dot?”</p>

<p>“Who’s Tommy Rooney?” asked Mrs. Adams.</p>

<p>The Corner House girls told them all about
Tommy, and how he had run away from home, and
why they half believed he had come here to Milton.</p>

<p>“To shoot Indians!” exclaimed Mrs. Adams.
“Whoever heard of such a crazy notion? Mercy!
boys get worse and worse, every day.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because of this conversation that
Tess and Dot at once thought of Tommy on the
way home that evening after the party, when they
saw a man and a dog chasing a small boy across
Willow Street near the old Corner House.</p>

<p>“That’s Sammy Pinkney’s bulldog,” declared
Tess, in fright. “And it’s Sammy’s father, too.”</p>

<p>The boy crawled over the high fence at the back
of their garden and got through the hedge. When
the girls caught up with the man, Tess asked:</p>

<p>“Oh, sir! what is the matter?”</p>

<p>“That young rascal has been in my strawberry
patch again,” declared Mr. Pinkney, wrathfully.
He seemed to forget that he had a boy of his own
who was always up to mischief. “I’d like to
wallop him.”</p>

<p>“But the dog might have bit him,” said Dot,
trembling, and drawing away from the ugly looking
animal.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, little girl,” said Mr. Pinkney, more
pleasantly. “Jock wouldn’t bite anybody. He
only scared him.”</p>

<p>“Well, he <i>looks</i> like he’d bite,” said Tess, doubtfully.
“And he scared our cat, Sandy-face, almost
to death.”</p>

<p>“Well, bulldogs always seem to think that cats
are their enemies. I am sorry he scared your cat,
girls.”</p>

<p>Tess and Dot hurried on to their gate. They
looked for the boy in the garden, but he was nowhere
to be found. When they entered the house,
the back door was open and everybody seemed to
be at the front.</p>

<p>The two girls went immediately up the back
stairs to the bathroom to wash and make themselves
tidy for dinner.</p>

<p>“Where do you s’pose he went, Tess?” asked
Dot, referring to the strange boy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Tess. Then she stopped
to listen in the hall outside the bathroom door.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Tess?” demanded Dot,
quickly. “Did you hear something? Up the garret
stairs?”</p>

<p>“It sounded like the latch of the garret door,”
said Tess. “But I guess it was just the wind.
Or maybe,” she added, laughing, “it was your
goat, Dot!”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said the smaller girl, in disgust.
“I know there isn’t any old goat living up in that
garret. That’s silly.”</p>

<p>The girls thought no more about the odd noise
at that time, but hurried to join the rest of the
family down stairs.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink16'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XVI—MORE MYSTERIES</a></h2>

<p>Some of Miss Ann Titus’ gossip was not unkindly,
and some of it amused Ruth and Agnes
very much.</p>

<p>Miss Titus had known Aunt Sarah when they
were both young girls and what she told the Corner
House girls about Miss Maltby, who had taken the
name of “Stower” of her own accord, satisfied
much of the curiosity the older Kenway girls felt
regarding Aunt Sarah and her affairs.</p>

<p>“I remember when old Mr. Stower married Mrs.
Maltby,” said the busy Miss Titus, nodding vigorously
as she snipped and talked at the same time.
“The goodness knows, Sally Maltby an’ her
mother was as poor as Job’s turkey—an’ they say
<i>he</i> was sartain-sure a lean fowl. It was as great
a change in their sarcumstances when they came
to the ol’ Corner House to live, as though they’d
been translated straight to the pearly gates—meanin’
no irreverence.</p>

<p>“They was sartain-sure dirt poor. I dunno
how Mis’ Maltby had the heart to stand up an’
face the minister long enough for him to say the
words over ’em, her black bombazeen was that
shabby! They had me here with Ma Britton (I
was ’prenticed to Ma Britton in them days) for
three solid months, a-makin’ both Mrs. Maltby-that-was,
an’ Sally, fit to be seen.</p>

<p>“An’ how Sally <i>did</i> turn her nose up, to be sure—to-be-sure!
I reckon she must ha’ soon got a
crick in her neck, holdin’ it so stiff. An’ to see
her an’ hear her, you’d ha’ thought she owned the
ol’ Corner House.</p>

<p>“They had sarvints here in them days, an’ ol’
Mr. Stower—he was still in practice at the law—had
lashin’s of company. I won’t say but that
Mrs. Maltby-that-was, made him a good wife, and
sat at the foot of his table, and poured tea out o’
that big solid silver urn like she’d been to the
manner born. But Sally was as sassy and perky
as a nuthatch in flytime.</p>

<p>“We other gals couldn’t git along with her no-how.
Me bein’ here so much right at the first of
it,” pursued Miss Titus, “sort o’ made me an’
Sally intimate, as ye might say, whether we’d ever
been so before, or not. After Ma Britton got
through her big job here Sally would sometimes
have to come around to our house—Ma Britton
left me that little cottage I live in—I ain’t ashamed
to tell it—I hadn’t any folks, an’ never had, I
reckon. Like <i>Topsy</i>, I ‘jes’ growed.’ Well!
Sally would come around to see me, and she’d invite
me to the old Corner House here.</p>

<p>“She never invited me here when there was any
doin’s—no, Ma’am!” exclaimed Miss Titus. “I
wonder if she remembers them times now? She
sits so grim an’ lets me run on ha’f a day at a
time, till I fairly foam at the mouth ’ith talkin’
so much, an’ then mebbe all she’ll say is: ‘Want
your tea now, Ann?’ ’Nuff ter give one the fibbertygibbets!</p>

<p>“In them days I speak of, she could talk a blue
streak—sartain-sure! And she’d tell me how
many folks ‘we had to dinner’ last night; or how
‘Judge Perriton and Judge Mercer was both in
for whist with us last evening.’ Well! she
strutted, and tossed her head, an’ bridled, till one
time there was an awful quarrel ’twixt her an’
Peter Stower.</p>

<p>“I was here. I heard part of it. Peter Stower
was a good bit older than Sally Maltby as you gals
may have heard. He objected to his father’s marriage—not
because Mrs. Maltby was who she was,
but he objected to anybody’s coming into the family.
Peter was a born miser—yes he was. He
didn’t want to divide his father’s property after
the old man’s death, with anybody.</p>

<p>“I will say for Peter,” added Miss Titus, “going
off on a tangent” as she would have said herself,
had she been critically listening to any other
narrator. “I will say for Peter, that after your
mother was born, gals, he really seemed to warm
up. I have seen him carrying your mother, when
she was a little tot, all about these big halls and
hummin’ to her like a bumblebee.</p>

<p>“But even at that, he influenced his father so
that only a small legacy came to your mother when
the old man died. Peter got most of the property
into his hands before <i>that</i> happened, anyway.
And quite right, too, I s’pose, for by that time he
had increased the estate a whole lot by his own
industry and foresight.</p>

<p>“Well, now! I have got to runnin’ away with
my story, ain’t I? It was about Sally and that
day she and Peter had their big quarrel. Whenever
Peter heard, or saw Sally giving herself airs,
he’d put in an oar and take her down a peg, now
I tell you!” said Miss Titus, mixing her metaphors
most woefully.</p>

<p>“I’d been to Sally’s room—it was a small one
tucked away back here in this ell, and <i>that</i> hurt
her like pizen! We was goin’ down stairs to the
front hall. Sally stops on the landing and points
to the ceiling overhead, what used to be painted
all over with flowers and fat cupids, and sech—done
by a famous artist they used to say when the
house was built years before, but gettin’ faded and
chipped then.</p>

<p>“So Sally points to the ceilin’ an’ says she:</p>

<p>“‘I hope some day,’ says she, ‘that we will have
that painting restored. <i>I</i> mean to, I am sure,
when I am in a better position to have my views
carried out here.’</p>

<p>“Of course, she didn’t mean nothin’—just
showin’ off in front of me,” said Miss Titus, shaking
her head and biting at a thread in her queer
fashion. “But right behind us on the stairs was
Peter. We didn’t know he was there.</p>

<p>“‘Wal,’ says he, drawlin’ in that nasty, sarcastic
way he had, ‘if you wait till your views air
carried out in <i>this</i> house, Sal Maltby, it’ll be never—you
hear me! I guarantee,’ sez Peter, ‘that
they’ll carry <i>you</i> out, feet fust, before they carry
out your idees.’</p>

<p>“My! she turns on him like a tiger-cat. Yes,
Ma’am! Sartain-sure I thought she was going to
fly at him, tooth an’ toe-nail! But Peter had a
temper like ice-water, an’ ice-water—nuff of it,
anyway—will put out fire ev’ry time.</p>

<p>“He just listened to her rave, he standin’ there
so cold an’ sarcastic. She told him how she was
going to live longer than he did, anyway, and that
in the end she’d have her way in the old Corner
House in spite of him!</p>

<p>“When she had sort of run-down like, Peter
says to her: ‘Brag’s a good dog, but Holdfast’s a
better,’ sez he. ‘It ain’t people that talks gits
what they want in this world. If I was you, Sal
Maltby, I’d learn to hold my teeth on my tongue.
It’ll git you farther.’</p>

<p>“And I b’lieve,” concluded Miss Titus, “that
just then was the time when Sally Maltby begun to
get tongue-tied. For you might’s well call her
that. I know I never heard her ‘blow,’ myself,
after that quarrel; and gradually she got to be just
the funny, silent, grim sort o’ person she is. Fact
is—an’ I admit it—Sally gives <i>me</i> the shivers oncet
in a while.”</p>

<p>Tess and Dorothy did not always play in the
garden, not even when the weather was fair.
There must be variety to make even play appealing,
although the dolls were all “at home” in the
out-of-door playhouse. Dot and Tess must go
visiting with their children once in a while.</p>

<p>They had a big room for their sleeping chamber
and sometimes they came, with a selection of the
dolls, and “visited” in the house. Being allowed
to play in the bedroom, as long as they “tidied
up” after the play was over, Tess and Dot did so.</p>

<p>Ruth had strictly forbidden them going to the
garret to play, unless she went along. The excuse
Ruth gave for this order was, that in the garret
the smaller girls were too far away from the rest
of the family.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot, the morning after Mrs. Adams
had made them the tea party, had a party for their
dolls in the big bedroom. Tess set her folding
table with the best of the dolls’ china. There were
peanut butter sandwiches, and a sliced pickle, and
a few creamed walnuts that Ruth had bought at
the Unique Candy Store and divided between the
younger girls.</p>

<p>They sat the dolls about the table and went down
to the kitchen for milk and hot water for the
“cambric tea,” as Mrs. Adams called the beverage.
When they came back Tess, who entered
first, almost dropped the pitcher of hot water.</p>

<p>“My goodness me!” she ejaculated.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Tessie?” asked Dot, toiling
on behind with milk and sugar.</p>

<p>“Some—somebody’s taken our dolls’ luncheon.
Oh, dear me!”</p>

<p>“It can’t be!” cried Dot, springing forward and
spilling the milk. “Why! those walnut-creams!
Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“They haven’t left a crumb,” wailed Tess.
“Isn’t that just mean?”</p>

<p>“Who’d ever do such a thing to us?” said Dot,
her lip trembling. “It <i>is</i> mean.”</p>

<p>“Why! it must be somebody in the house,” declared
Tess, her wits beginning to work.</p>

<p>“Of course it wasn’t Mrs. McCall. She’s in the
kitchen,” Dot declared.</p>

<p>“Or Uncle Rufus. He’s in the garden.”</p>

<p>“And Ruth wouldn’t do such a thing,” added
Dot.</p>

<p>“It couldn’t be Aunt Sarah,” said Tess, eliminating
another of the family group.</p>

<p>“And I don’t think Miss Titus would do such a
thing,” hesitated Dot.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Tess.</p>

<p>“Well!” echoed Dot.</p>

<p>Both had come to the same and inevitable conclusion.
There was but one person left in the
house to accuse.</p>

<p>“Aggie’s been playing a joke on us,” both girls
stated, with conviction.</p>

<p>But Agnes had played no joke. She had been
out to the store for Mrs. McCall at the time the
children were in the kitchen. Besides, Agnes
“would not fib about it,” as Tess declared.</p>

<p>The disappearance of the dolls’ feast joined
hands, it seemed to Dot, with that mysterious
<i>something</i> that she knew she had heard Ruth and
Agnes talking about at night, and which the
younger girl had thought referred to a goat in the
garret.</p>

<p>“It’s just the mysteriousest thing,” she began,
speaking to Tess, when the latter suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Sandy-face!”</p>

<p>The mother cat was just coming out of the bigger
girls’ bedroom. She sat down at the head of
the main flight of stairs and calmly washed her
face. Sandy-face had the run of the house and
her presence was driving out the mice, who had
previously gnawed at their pleasure behind the
wainscoting.</p>

<p>“You—you don’t suppose Sandy-face did
that?” gasped Dot.</p>

<p>“Who else?” asked Tess.</p>

<p>“All of those walnuts?” said Dot, in horror.
“And those sandwiches? And not leave a crumb
on the plates?”</p>

<p>“She looks just as though she had,” determined
Tess.</p>

<p>“You—you are an awful bad cat, Sandy-face,”
said Dot, almost in tears. “And I just hope those
walnuts will disagree with your stomach—so
now!”</p>

<p>Tess was quite angry with the cat herself. She
stamped her foot and cried “Shoo!” Sandy-face
leaped away, surprised by such attentions, and
scrambled up stairs in a hurry. Almost at once
the two girls heard her utter a surprised yowl, and
down she came from the garret, her tail as large
as three tails, her eyes like saucers, and every indication
of panic in her movements.</p>

<p>She shot away for the back stairs, and so down
to the hall and out of doors.</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” exclaimed Dot. “I know those
walnuts are disagreeing with her right now, and
I’m glad. My! but she was punished soon for her
greediness, wasn’t she, Tess?”</p>

<p>There was something going on at the Creamer
cottage, next door to the old Corner House. Tess
and Dot became aware of this fact at about this
time, so did not bother their heads much about
Sandy’s supposed gluttony. Some of the windows
on the second floor of the cottage were darkened,
and every morning a closed carriage stopped
before the house and a man went in with a black
bag in his hand.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot were soon wondering what could
be happening to the little Creamer girls. The
only one they saw was the curly haired one, who
had spoken so unpleasantly to them on a particular
occasion. They saw her wandering about the
yard, and knew that she did not play, and was
often crying by herself behind the clumps of
bushes.</p>

<p>So Tess, whose heart was opened immediately to
any suffering thing, ventured near the picket
fence again, and at last spoke to the Creamer
girl.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, please?” Tess asked.
“Did you lose anything? Can we help you find
it?”</p>

<p>The curly headed girl looked at her in surprise.
Her pretty face was all streaked with tears.</p>

<p>“You—you want to keep away from me!” she
blurted out.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, me!” said Tess, clinging to Dot’s
hand. “I didn’t mean to offend you again.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll catch it, maybe,” sniffled the
Creamer girl, whose name was Mabel.</p>

<p>“Catch what?” asked Tess.</p>

<p>“Something dreadful. All my sisters have it.”</p>

<p>“Goodness!” breathed Dot.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Tess, bravely standing
her ground.</p>

<p>“It’s <i>quarantine</i>,” declared Mabel Creamer,
solemnly. “And I have to sleep in the library,
and I can’t go up stairs. Neither does pop. And
mamma never comes down stairs at all. And I
have to play alone here in the yard,” sighed
Mabel. “It’s just awful!”</p>

<p>“I should think it was,” gasped Tess. “Then,
that must be a doctor that comes to your house
every day?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And he is real mean. He won’t let me
see mamma—only she comes to the top of the
stairs and I have to stay at the bottom. Quarantine’s
a <i>nawful</i> thing to have in the house.</p>

<p>“So you’d better stand farther off from that
fence. I was real mean to you girls once, and I’m
sorry enough now. But I hadn’t ought to play
with you, for maybe <i>I’ll</i> have the quarantine, too,
and I’ll give it to you if you come too close.”</p>

<p>“But we can play games together without coming
too near,” said Tess, her kind heart desiring
to help their neighbor. “We’ll play keep house—and
there’ll be a river between us—and we can
talk over a telephone—and all that.” And soon
the three little girls were playing a satisfying
game together and Mabel’s tears were dried and
her heart comforted for the time being.</p>

<p>That night at dinner, however, Dot waxed curious.
“Is quarantine a very bad disease? Do
folks die of it?” she asked.</p>

<p>So the story came out, and the older girls
laughed at the young one’s mistake. It was
learned that all the Creamer children save Mabel
had the measles.</p>

<p>Ruth, however, was more puzzled about the
novelty of a cat eating peanut butter and walnut
creams than Dot had been about that wonderful
disease, “quarantine.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink17'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XVII—“MRS. TROUBLE”</a></h2>

<p>“You girls go through this pantry,” complained
Mrs. McCall, “like the plague of locusts.
There isn’t a doughnut left. Nor a sugar cookie.
I managed to save some of the seed-cakes for tea,
if you should have company, by hiding them away.</p>

<p>“I honestly thought I made four apple pies
on Monday; I can’t account but for three of them.
A hearty appetite is a good gift; but I should suggest
more bread and butter between meals, and
less sweets.”</p>

<p>Ruth took the matter up with the Corner House
girls in convention assembled:</p>

<p>“Here it is only Thursday, and practically all
the week’s baking is gone. We must restrain
ourselves, children. Remember how it used to
be a real event, when we could bake a raisin cake
on Saturday? We have no right to indulge our
tastes for sweets, as Mrs. McCall says. Who
knows? We may have to go back to the hard
fare of Bloomingsburg again, sometime.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never!” cried Agnes, in alarm.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that, sister?” asked Tess,
worried.</p>

<p>“Then we’d better eat all the good things we
can, now,” Dot, the modern philosopher, declared.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that, Ruth,” said Agnes, repeating
Tess’ words. “There is no doubt but
that Uncle Peter meant us to have this house and
all his money, and we’ll have it for good.”</p>

<p>“Not for bad, I hope, at any rate,” sighed Ruth.
“But we must mind what Mrs. McCall says about
putting our hands in the cookie jars.”</p>

<p>“But, if we get hungry?” Agnes declared.</p>

<p>“Then bread and butter will taste good to us,”
finished Ruth.</p>

<p>“I am sure I haven’t been at the cookie jar any
more than usual this week,” the twelve-year-old
said.</p>

<p>“Nor me,” Tess added.</p>

<p>“Maybe Sandy did it,” suggested Dot. “She
ate up all the dolls’ dinner—greedy thing!”</p>

<p>Agnes was puzzled. She said to the oldest
Corner House girl when the little ones were out
of earshot:</p>

<p>“I wonder if it <i>was</i> that cat that ate the dolls’
feast yesterday?”</p>

<p>“How else could it have disappeared?” demanded
Ruth.</p>

<p>“But a cat eating cream walnuts!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Ruth. “But of course,
it wasn’t Sandy-face that has been dipping into
the cookie jars. We must be good, Agnes. I
tell you that we may be down to short commons
again, as we used to be in Bloomingsburg. We
must be careful.”</p>

<p>Just why Ruth seemed to wish to economize,
Agnes could not understand. Her older sister
puzzled Agnes. Instead of taking the good things
that had come into their lives here at the old
Corner House with joy, Ruth seemed to be more
than ever worried. At least, Agnes was sure that
Ruth smiled even less frequently than had been
her wont.</p>

<p>When Ruth chanced to be alone with Miss Titus,
instead of her mind being fixed upon dressmaking
details, she was striving to gather from the seamstress
more particulars of those strange claimants
to Uncle Peter’s estate.</p>

<p>Not that Miss Titus had much to tell. She had
only surmises to offer. Mrs. Bean, though claiming
to know the people very well, had told the
spinster lady very little about them.</p>

<p>“Their names is Treble, I understand,” said
Miss Titus. “I never heard of no family of
Trebles living in Milton here—no, Ma’am! But
you can’t tell. Folks claiming relationship always
turn up awful unexpected where there’s
money to be divided.”</p>

<p>“Mother was only half sister to Uncle Peter,”
said Ruth, reflectively. “But Uncle Peter was
never married.”</p>

<p>“Not as anybody in Milton ever heard on,” admitted
Miss Titus.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose Aunt Sarah would know who
these people are?” queried Ruth.</p>

<p>“You can just take it from me,” said Miss
Titus, briskly, “that Sally Maltby never knew
much about Peter’s private affairs. Never half
as much as she claimed to know, and not a quarter
of what she’d <i>liked</i> to have known!</p>

<p>“That’s why she had to get out of the old Corner
House——”</p>

<p>“Did she <i>have</i> to?” interrupted Ruth, quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, she did,” said the seamstress, nodding
confidently. “Although old Mr. Stower promised
her mother she should have shelter here as
long as Sally lived, he died without making a will.
Mrs. Maltby-that-was, died first. So there wasn’t
any legal claim Sally Maltby could make. She
stayed here only by Peter’s sufferance, and she
couldn’t be content.</p>

<p>“Sally learned only one lesson—that of keeping
her tongue between her teeth,” pursued Miss
Titus. “Peter declared she was always snooping
around, and watching and listening. Sally always
was a stubborn thing, and she had got it
into her head that she had rights here—which of
course, she never had.</p>

<p>“So finally Peter forbade her coming into the
front part of the house at all; then she went to
live with your folks, and Peter washed his hands
of her. I expect, like all misers, Peter wanted to
hide things about the old house and didn’t want
to be watched. Do you know if Howbridge found
much of the old man’s hidings?”</p>

<p>“I do not know about that,” said Ruth, smiling.
“But Uncle Rufus thinks Uncle Peter used to hide
things away in the garret.”</p>

<p>“In the garret?” cried Miss Titus, shrilly.
“Well, then! they’d stay there for all of me. I
wouldn’t hunt up there for a pot of gold!”</p>

<p>Nor would Ruth—for she did not expect any
such hoard as that had been hidden away in the
garret by Uncle Peter. She often looked curiously
at Aunt Sarah, however, when she sat with
the old lady, tempted to ask her point-blank what
she knew about Uncle Peter’s secrets.</p>

<p>When a person is as silent as Aunt Sarah
habitually was, it is only natural to surmise that
the silent one may have much to tell. Ruth had
not the courage, however, to advance the subject.
She, like her younger sisters, stood in no little
awe of grim Aunt Sarah.</p>

<p>Mr. Howbridge remained away and Miss Titus
completed such work as Ruth dared have done,
and removed her machine and cutting table from
the old Corner House. The days passed for the
Kenway girls in cheerful occupations and such
simple pleasures as they had been used to all their
lives.</p>

<p>Agnes would, as she frankly said, have been
glad to “make a splurge.” She begged to give a
party to the few girls they had met but Ruth
would not listen to any such thing.</p>

<p>“I think it’s mean!” Aggie complained. “We
want to get folks to coming here. If they think
the old house is haunted, we want to prove to them
that it is haunted only by the Spirit of Hospitality.”</p>

<p>“Very fine! very fine!” laughed Ruth. “But
we shall have to wait for that, until we are more
secure in our footing here.”</p>

<p>“‘More secure!’” repeated Agnes. “When
will that ever be? I don’t believe Mr. Howbridge
will ever find Uncle Peter’s will. I’d like to hunt
myself for it.”</p>

<p>“And perhaps <i>that</i> might not be a bad idea,”
sighed Ruth, to herself. “Perhaps we ought to
search the old house from cellar to garret for
Uncle Peter’s hidden papers.”</p>

<p>Something happened, however, before she could
carry out this half-formed intention. Tess and
Dot had gone down Main Street on an errand for
Ruth. Coming back toward the old Corner
House, they saw before them a tall, dark lady,
dressed in a long summer mantle, a lace bonnet,
and other bits of finery that marked her as different
from the ordinary Milton matron doing her
morning’s marketing. She had a little girl with
her.</p>

<p>“I never saw those folks before,” said Dot to
Tess.</p>

<p>“No. They must be strangers. That little
girl is wearing a pretty dress, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>Tess and Dot came abreast of the two. The
little girl <i>was</i> very showily dressed. Her pink
and white face was very angelic in its expression—while
in repose. But she chanced to look around
and see the Kenway girls looking at her, and instantly
she stuck out her tongue and made a face.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! She’s worse than that Mabel
Creamer,” said Tess, and she took Dot’s hand and
would have hurried by, had the lady not stopped
them.</p>

<p>“Little girls! little girls!” she said, commandingly.
“Tell me where the house is, in which Mr.
Peter Stower lived. It is up this way somewhere
they told me at the station.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Ma’am,” said Tess, politely. “It is
the old Corner House—<i>our</i> house.”</p>

<p>“<i>Your</i> house?” said the tall lady, sharply.
“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“We live there,” said Tess, bravely. “We are
two of the Kenway girls. Then there are Ruth
and Agnes. And Aunt Sarah. We all live
there.”</p>

<p>“You reside in Mr. Peter Stower’s house?”
said the lady, with emphasis, and looking not at
all pleasant, Tess thought. “How long have you
resided there?”</p>

<p>“Ever since we came to Milton. We were
Uncle Peter’s only relations, so Mr. Howbridge
came for us and put us in the house,” explained
Tess, gravely.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stower’s only relatives?” repeated the
lady, haughtily. “We will see about <i>that</i>. You
may lead on to the house. At least, I am sure we
have as much right there as a parcel of girls.”</p>

<p>Tess and Dot were troubled, but they led the
way. Agnes and Ruth were on the big front porch
sewing and they saw the procession enter the gate.</p>

<p>“Goodness me! who’s this coming?” asked
Agnes, eyeing the dark lady with startled curiosity.
“Looks as though she owned the place.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Agnes!” gasped Ruth, and sprang to her
feet. She met the lady at the steps.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked the stranger, sourly.</p>

<p>“I am Ruth Kenway. Did you—you wish to
see me, Ma’am?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care whom I see,” the lady answered
decisively, marching right up the steps and leading
the angel-faced little girl by the hand. “I
want you to know that I am Mrs. Treble. Mrs.
John Augustus Treble. My daughter Lillie
(stand straight, child!) and I, have been living
in Michigan. John Augustus has been dead five
years. He was blown up in a powder-mill explosion,
so I can prove his death very easily. So,
when I heard that my husband’s uncle, Mr. Peter
Stower, was dead here in Milton, I decided to come
on and get Lillie’s share of the property.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” murmured Ruth and Agnes, in chorus.</p>

<p>“I am not sure that, as John Augustus Treble’s
widow, my claims to the estate do not come clearly
ahead of <i>yours</i>. I understand that you Kenway
girls are merely here on sufferance, and that the
ties of relationship between you and Mr. Peter
Stower are very scant indeed. Of course, I suppose
the courts will have to decide the matter, but
meanwhile you may show me to my room. I don’t
care to pay a hotel bill, and it looks to me as
though there were plenty of rooms, and to spare,
in this ugly old house.”</p>

<p>Ruth was left breathless. But Agnes was able
to whisper in her sister’s ear:</p>

<p>“‘Mrs. Treble’ indeed! She looks to me, Ruth,
a whole lot like ‘Mrs. Trouble.’ What <i>shall</i> we
do?”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink18'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XVIII—RUTH DOES WHAT SHE THINKS IS RIGHT</a></h2>

<p>Mrs. Treble, as the tall, dark lady called herself,
had such an air of assurance and command,
that Ruth was at a loss what course to take with
her. Finally the oldest Kenway girl found voice
to say:</p>

<p>“Won’t you take one of these comfortable
rockers, Mrs. Treble? Perhaps we had better
first talk the matter over a little.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad to sit down,” admitted Mrs.
Treble. “Don’t muss your dress, Lillie. We’ve
been traveling some ways, as I tell you. Clean
from Ypsilanti. We came on from Cleveland
Junction this morning, and it’s a hot day. <i>Don’t</i>
rub your shoes together, Lillie.”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> very warm,” said Ruth, handing their
visitor a fan and sending Agnes for a glass of cold
water from the icebox.</p>

<p>“Then we’ve been to that lawyer’s office,” pursued
Mrs. Treble. “What do you call him—Howbridge?
Don’t rub your hands on your skirt,
Lillie.”</p>

<p>“Yes; Mr. Howbridge,” replied Ruth.</p>

<p>“<i>Don’t</i> take off that hat, Lillie. So we’ve been
walking in the sun some. That’s nice, cool water.
Have some, Lillie? Don’t drip it on your dress.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t your little girl like to go with Tess
and Dot to the playhouse in the garden?” Ruth
suggested. “Then we can talk.”</p>

<p>“Why—yes,” said Mrs. Treble. “Go with the
little girls, Lillie. Don’t you get a speck of dirt
on you, Lillie.”</p>

<p>Ruth did not see the awful face the much admonished
Lillie made, as she left her mother’s
side. It amazed Tess and Dot so that they could
not speak. Her tongue went into her cheek, and
she drew down the corners of her mouth and rolled
her eyes, leering so terribly, that for an instant
she looked like nothing human. Then she resumed
the placidity of her angelic expression, and
minced along after the younger Kenway girls,
and out of sight around a corner of the house.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Agnes had drawn Ruth aside, and
whispered: “What are you going to do? She’s
raving crazy, isn’t she? Had I better run for a
doctor—or the police?”</p>

<p>“Sh!” admonished Ruth. “She is by no means
crazy. I don’t know <i>what</i> to do!”</p>

<p>“But she says she has a right to live here, too,”
gasped Agnes.</p>

<p>“Perhaps she has.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Howbridge said we were Uncle Peter’s
only heirs,” said Agnes, doggedly.</p>

<p>“May—maybe he didn’t know about this John
Augustus Treble. We must find out about it,”
said Ruth, much worried. “Of course, we
wouldn’t want to keep anybody out of the property,
if they had a better right to it.”</p>

<p>“<i>What?</i>” shrilled Agnes. “Give it up? Not—on—your—life!”</p>

<p>In the meantime, Tess and Dot scarcely knew
how to talk to Lillie Treble. She was such a
strange girl! They had never seen anybody at
all like her before.</p>

<p>Lillie walked around the house, out of her
mother’s sight, just as mincingly as a peacock
struts. Her look of angelic sweetness would have
misled anybody. She just looked as though she
had never done a single wrong thing in all her
sweet young life!</p>

<p>But Tess and Dot quickly found that Lillie
Treble was not at all the perfect creature she appeared
to the casual observer. Her angelic sweetness
was all a sham. Away from her mother’s
sharp eye, Lillie displayed very quickly her true
colors.</p>

<p>“Those all your dolls?” she demanded, when
she was shown the collection of Tess and Dot in
the garden house.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tess.</p>

<p>“Well, my mother says we’re going to stay here,
and if you want me to play with you,” said this
infantile socialist, “we might as well divide them
up right now.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Tess.</p>

<p>“I’ll take a third of them. They can be easily
divided. I choose <i>this</i> one to begin with,” said
Lillie, diving for the Alice-doll.</p>

<p>With a shriek of alarm, Dot rescued this—her
choicest possession—and stood on the defensive,
the Alice-doll clasped close to her breast.</p>

<p>“No! you can’t have that,” said Tess, decidedly.</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Lillie.</p>

<p>“Why—it’s the doll Dot loves the best.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Lillie, calmly, “I suppose if I
chose one of <i>yours</i>, you’d holler, too. I never did
see such selfish girls. Huh! if I can’t have the
dolls I want, I won’t choose any. I don’t want to
play with the old things, anyway!” and she made
a most dreadful face at the Kenway sisters.</p>

<p>“Oh-oh!” whispered Dot. “I don’t like her at
all.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we must amuse her,” said
Tess, strong for duty.</p>

<p>“But she says she is going to stay here all the
time,” pursued the troubled Dot, as Lillie wandered
off toward the foot of the garden.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that can be so,” said Tess,
faintly. “But it’s our duty to entertain her,
while she <i>is</i> here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why we should. She’s not a nice
girl at all,” Dot objected.</p>

<p>“Dot! you know very well Ruth wants us to
look out for her,” Tess said, with emphasis. “We
can’t get out of it.”</p>

<p>So the younger girl, over-ruled by Tess, followed
on. At the foot of the garden, Lillie caught
sight of Ruth’s flock of hens. Uncle Rufus had
repaired the henhouse and run, and Ruth had
bought in the market a dozen hens and a rooster
of the white Plymouth Rock breed. Mr. Rooster
strutted around the enclosure very proudly with
his family. They were all very tame, for the children
made pets of them.</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever let them out?” asked Lillie,
peering through the wire-screen.</p>

<p>“No. Not now, Ruth says. They would get
into the garden,” Tess replied.</p>

<p>“Huh! you could shoo them out again. I had
a pet hen at Ypsilanti. I’d rather have hens than
dolls, anyway. The hens are alive,” and she tried
the gate entering upon the hen-run.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Tess. “You mustn’t let them
out.”</p>

<p>“Who’s letting them out?” demanded Lillie.</p>

<p>“Well, then, you mustn’t go into the yard.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” repeated the visitor.</p>

<p>“Ruth won’t like it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess my mother’s got more to say
about this place than your sister has. She says
she’s going to show a parcel of girls how to run
this house, and run it right. That’s what she told
Aunt Adeline and Uncle Noah, when we went to
live with them in Ypsilanti.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, Lillie opened the gate and
walked into the poultry yard. At once there was
great excitement in the flock. Lillie plunged at
the nearest hen and missed her. The rooster uttered
a startled and admonitory “Cut! cut! ca-dar-cut!”
and led the procession of frightened
hens about the yard.</p>

<p>“Aren’t hens foolish?” demanded Lillie, calmly.
“I am not going to hurt her.”</p>

<p>She made another dive for the hen. The rooster
uttered another shriek of warning and went
through the watering-pan, flapping his wings like
mad. The water was spilled, and the next attempt
Lillie made to seize a hen, she was precipitated
into the puddle!</p>

<p>Both hands, one knee, and the front of her frock
were immediately streaked with mud. Lillie
shrieked her anger, and plunged after the frightened
hens again. She was a determined girl.
Tess and Dot added their screams to the general
hullabaloo.</p>

<p>Round and round went the hens, led by the gallant
rooster. Finally the inevitable happened.
Lillie got both hands upon one of the white hens.</p>

<p>“Now I got you—silly!” shrieked Lillie.</p>

<p>But she spoke too quickly and too confidently.
It was only the tail-feathers Lillie grabbed.
With a wild squawk, the hen flew straight away,
leaving the bulk of her plumage in the naughty
girl’s hands!</p>

<p>The girls outside the fence continued to scream,
and so did the flock of hens. The rooster, who
was a heavy bird, came around the yard again, on
another lap, and wildly leaped upon Lillie’s back.</p>

<p>He scrambled over her, his great spurs and
claws tearing her frock, and his wings beating her
breathlessly to the ground. Just then Uncle
Rufus came hobbling along.</p>

<p>“Glo-ree! who dat chile in dat hen-cage?” he
demanded. “Dat ol’ rooster’ll put her eyes out
for her—dat he will!”</p>

<p>He opened the gate, went in, and grabbed up
Lillie Treble from the ground. When he set her
on her feet outside the fence, she was a sight to
behold!</p>

<p>“Glo-ree!” gasped Uncle Rufus. “What you
doin’ in dar, chile?”</p>

<p>“Mind your own business!” exclaimed Lillie.
“You’re only a black man. I don’t have to mind
<i>you</i>, I hope.”</p>

<p>She was covered with mud and dust, and her
frock was in great disarray, but she was self-contained—and
as saucy as ever. Tess and Dot were
horrified by her language.</p>

<p>“I dunno who yo’ is, gal!” exclaimed Uncle
Rufus. “But yo’ let Missie Ruth’s chickens
erlone, or I’ll see ter yuh, lak’ yer was one o’ my
own gran’chillen.”</p>

<p>Lillie was sullen—and just a little frightened
of Uncle Rufus. The disaster made but slight
impression upon her mind.</p>

<p>“What—what will your mother say?” gasped
Tess, when the three girls were alone again.</p>

<p>“She won’t say anything—till she sees me,”
sniffed Lillie. And to put that evil hour off, she
began to inquire as to further possibilities for action
about the old Corner House.</p>

<p>“What do you girls do?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Tess, “we play house; and play
go visiting; and—and roll hoop; and sometimes
skip rope——”</p>

<p>“Huh! that’s dreadful tame. Don’t you ever
<i>do</i> anything——Oh! there’s my mother!” A
window had opened in one of the wings of the big
house, on the second floor. It was a window of
a room that the Kenway family had not before
used. Tess and Dot saw Ruth as well as Mrs.
Treble at the window.</p>

<p>Ruth was doing what she thought was right.
Mrs. Treble had confessed to the oldest of the
Corner House girls that she had arrived at Milton
with scarcely any money. She could not pay her
board even at the very cheapest hotel. Mr. Howbridge
was away, Ruth knew, and nothing could
be done to straighten out this tangle in affairs
until the lawyer came back.</p>

<p>So she had offered Mrs. Treble shelter for the
present. Moreover, the lady, with a confidence
equaled only by Aunt Sarah’s, demanded in quite
a high and mighty way to be housed and fed.
Yet she had calmed down, and actually thanked
Ruth for her hospitality, when she found that the
girl was not to be intimidated, but was acting the
part of a Good Samaritan from a sense of duty.</p>

<p>Agnes was too angry for words. She could not
understand why Ruth should cater to this “Mrs.
Trouble,” as she insisted, in secret, upon calling
the woman from Ypsilanti.</p>

<p>Ruth was showing the visitor a nice room on
the same floor with those chambers occupied by
the girls themselves, and Mrs. Treble was approving,
when she chanced to look out of the window
and behold her angelic Lillie in the condition related
above.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink19'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XIX—“DOUBLE TROUBLE”</a></h2>

<p>“What is the meaning of that horrid condition
of your clothing, Lillie?” demanded Mrs. Treble
from the open window.</p>

<p>“I fell in the mud, Mamma,” said the unabashed
Lillie, and glanced aside at Tess and Dot
with a sweetly troubled look, as though she feared
they were at fault for her disarray, but did not
quite like to say so!</p>

<p>“Come up here at once!” commanded her
mother, who turned to Ruth to add: “I am
afraid your sisters are very rough and rude in
their play. Lillie has not been used to such playmates.
Of course, left without a mother as
they were, nothing better can be expected of
them.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lillie had turned one of her frightful
grimaces upon Tess and Dot before starting
for the house, and the smaller Kenway girls were
left frozen in their tracks by the ferocity of this
parting glare.</p>

<p>Lillie appeared at luncheon dressed in some of
Tess’ garments and some of Dot’s—none of them
fitting her very well. She had a sweetly
forgiving air, which bolstered up her mother’s opinion
that Tess and Dot were guilty of leading her angelic
child astray.</p>

<p>Mrs. Treble had two trunks at the railway station
and Uncle Rufus was sent to get an expressman
to bring them up to the Corner House. Ruth
paid the expressman.</p>

<p>“Talk about the <i>Old Man of the Sea</i> that <i>Sinbad</i>
had to carry on his shoulders!” scoffed Agnes,
in private, to Ruth. “This Mrs. Trouble is
going to be a bigger burden for us than he was.
And I believe that girl is going to be ‘Double
Trouble.’ She looks like butter wouldn’t melt in
her mouth. Uncle Rufus says she got in that
messy condition before lunch, chasing the hens
out of their seven senses.”</p>

<p>“There are only five senses, Aggie,” said Ruth,
patiently.</p>

<p>“Humph! that’s all right for folks, but hens
have two more, I reckon,” chuckled the younger
girl.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ruth, “we must treat Mrs. Treble
politely.”</p>

<p>“You act as though you really thought they
had some right to come here and live on us,”
cried Agnes.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they have a right to some of Uncle
Peter’s property. We don’t know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it! She’s the sort of a person—that
Mrs. Trouble—who assumes rights wherever
she goes.”</p>

<p>Ruth had to confess that Mrs. Treble <i>was</i> trying.
She criticised Mrs. McCall’s cooking and
the quantity of food on the table at luncheon.
Lillie did not like dried apple pies, and said so
bluntly, with a hostile glare at the dessert in question.</p>

<p>“Well, little girl,” said Mrs. McCall, “you’ll
have to learn to like them. I’ve just bought quite
a lot of dried apples and they’ve got to be eaten
up.”</p>

<p>Lillie made another awful face—but her
mother did not see it. Dot was so awe-stricken
by these facial gymnastics of the strange girl
that she could scarcely eat, and watched Lillie
continually.</p>

<p>“That child ought to be cured of staring so,”
remarked Mrs. Treble, frowning at Dot. “Or is
her eyesight bad?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Treble was busy, after her trunks came,
in unpacking them and arranging her room to
suit herself—as though she expected to make a
long visit. She had suggested appropriating
Uncle Peter’s old bedroom in the front of the
house, but that suite of rooms was locked, and
Ruth refrained from telling her that <i>she</i> had the
keys.</p>

<p>Meantime the bigger Corner House girls tried
to help the smaller ones entertain Lillie. Lillie
was not like any normal girl whom they had ever
known. She wanted to do only things in which
she could lead, and if she was denied her way in
any particular, she “wouldn’t play” and threatened
to go up stairs and tell her mother.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Agnes, first to become exasperated.
“You want to be the whole show—including
the drum-major at the head of the procession,
and the little boys following the clown’s donkey-cart
at the end!”</p>

<p>Lillie made a face.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Ruth, quietly, “that if I were
you, Lillie, and went to visit, I’d try to make my
new friends like me.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” said Lillie. “I’m not visiting—don’t
you fool yourselves. My mother and I have come
here to stay. We’re not going to be put out like
we were at Aunt Adeline’s and Uncle Noah’s.
Mother says we’ve got more right to this old
house than you Kenways have, and she’s going to
get her rights.”</p>

<p>That made Dot cry, and Tess looked dreadfully
serious. Agnes was too angry to play with the
girl any more, and Ruth, even, gave her up as
impossible. Lillie wandered off by herself, for
her mother would not be bothered with her just
then.</p>

<p>When Mrs. McCall went out into the kitchen
that afternoon to start dinner, she missed the
bag of dried apples that had been left on the
table. There had been nearly four pounds of
them.</p>

<p>“What under the canopy’s become of that
bag?” demanded the good lady. “This is
getting too much, I declare. I <i>know</i> I missed the
end of the corned beef yesterday, and half a loaf
of bread. I couldn’t be sure about the cookies
and doughnuts, and the pie.</p>

<p>“But there that bag of dried apples stood, and
there it <i>isn’t</i> now! What do you know about
such crazy actions?” she demanded of Ruth, who
had come at her call.</p>

<p>“Why! it’s a mystery,” gasped the eldest of
the Corner House girls. “I can’t understand it,
dear Mrs. McCall. Of course none of us girls
have taken the dried apples. And if you have
missed other things from your pantry of late, I
am just as sure we are not at fault. I have
warned the girls about raiding the cookie jars
between meals.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. McCall, with awe, “what
can have taken them? And a bag of dried apples!
Goodness! It’s enough to give one the
shivers and shakes.”</p>

<p>Ruth was deeply mystified, too. She knew
very well that Sandy-face, the cat, could not be
accused with justice of this loss. Cats certainly
do not eat dried apples—and such a quantity!</p>

<p>It began to rain before evening, and Tess and
Dot rushed out to rescue their dolls and other
playthings, for there was wind with the rain and
they were afraid it would blow in upon their
treasures.</p>

<p>Here poor Dot received an awful shock. The
Alice-doll was gone!</p>

<p>Dot went in crying to Ruth and would not be
comforted. She loved the missing doll as though
it was a real, live baby—there could be no doubt
of that. And why should a thief take that lovely
doll only, and leave all the others?</p>

<p>Mysteries were piling upon mysteries! It was
a gloomy night out of doors and a gloomy night
inside the old Corner House as well. Mrs. Treble’s
air and conversation were sufficient alone to
make the Kenway girls down-hearted. Dot cried
herself to sleep that night, and not even Agnes
could comfort her.</p>

<p>The wind howled around the house, and tried
every latch and shutter fastening. Ruth lay
abed and wondered if the thing she had seen at
the window in the garret on that other windy
day was now appearing and vanishing in its spectral
way?</p>

<p>And what should she do about Mrs. Treble and
her little girl? What would Mr. Howbridge say
when he came home again?</p>

<p>Had she any right to spend more of the estate’s
money in caring for these two strangers
who were (according to the lady herself) without
any means at all? Ruth Kenway put in two
very bad hours that night, before she finally fell
asleep.</p>

<p>The sun shone brightly in the morning, however.
How much better the world and all that is
in it seems on a clean, sunshiny morning! Even
Dot was able to control her tears, as she went out
upon the back porch with Tess, before breakfast.</p>

<p>The rain had saturated everything. The
brown dirt path had been scoured and then gullied
by the hard downpour. Right at the corner
of the woodshed, where the water ran off in a
cataract, when it <i>did</i> rain, was a funny looking
mound.</p>

<p>“Why—why! what’s that?” gasped Dot.</p>

<p>“It looks just as though a poor little baby had
been buried there,” whispered Tess. “But of
course, it isn’t! Maybe there’s some animal trying
to crawl out of the ground.”</p>

<p>“O-o-o!” squealed Dot. “<i>What</i> animal?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Not a mole. Moles don’t
make such a big hump in the ground.”</p>

<p>As the girls wondered, Uncle Rufus came up
from the henhouse. He saw the strange looking
mound, too.</p>

<p>“Glo-ree!” he gasped. “How come dat?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know, Uncle Rufus,” said Tess
eagerly. “We just found it.”</p>

<p>“Somebody been buryin’ a dawg in we-uns
back yard? My soul!”</p>

<p>“Oh, it can’t be!” cried Tess.</p>

<p>“And it isn’t Sandy-face,” Dot declared.
“For she’s in the kitchen with all her children.”</p>

<p>“Wait er bit—wait er bit,” said the old man,
solemnly. “Unc’ Rufus gwine ter look inter dis yere
matter. It sho’ is a misery”—meaning
“mystery.”</p>

<p>He brought a shovel and dug down beside the
mound. Lifting out a huge shovelful of dirt,
there were scattered all about the path a great
number of swollen and messy brown things that,
for a moment, the girls did not identify. Then
Uncle Rufus lifted up his voice in a roar:</p>

<p>“Looker yere! Looker yere! Missie Ruth!
see wot you-all mak’ out o’ disher monkey-shines.
Here’s dem dried apples, buried in de groun’ and
swelled fit ter bust demselves.”</p>

<div style='text-align:center'>
<img id='ilink03' src='images/illus-003.jpg' alt=''/>
<p class='caption'>“Looker yere! Looker yere! Missie Ruth! There dem dried apples, buried in de groun’”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. McCall as well as the other girls came running
to see. It was Agnes that saw something
else under the mound. She darted down the
steps, put her hand into the hole and drew out the
Alice-doll!</p>

<p>The poor thing’s dress was ruined. Its hair
was a mass of plastered apple, and its face as
well. Such a disreputable looking thing!</p>

<p>While the others cried out in wonder and disclaimed
all knowledge of how the marvel could
have happened, Agnes spoke two accusing words.</p>

<p>“Double Trouble!” she cried, pointing her
finger at Lillie Treble, who had just appeared,
angelic face and all, at the back door.</p>

<p>“Did that young’un do that?” demanded Mrs.
McCall, vigorously.</p>

<p>“She most certainly did,” declared Agnes.
“She tried to get rid of the dried apples, and the
doll Dot wouldn’t let her play with, at one and the
same time. Isn’t she the mean thing?”</p>

<p>Instantly Lillie’s face was convulsed into a
mask of rage and dislike. “I hate all you girls!”
she snarled. “I’ll do worse than that to you!”</p>

<p>Mrs. McCall seized her like an eagle pouncing
upon a rabbit. Mrs. McCall was very vigorous.
She carried Lillie into the kitchen with one hand,
and laid her abruptly, face down, over her knee.</p>

<p>What happened during the next few moments
was evidently the surprise of Lillie Treble’s
young life. Her mother had never corrected her
in that good, old-fashioned way.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink20'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XX—MR. HOWBRIDGE IS PERPLEXED</a></h2>

<p>Tess and Dot went out that morning, when the
sun had dried the grass, to play with the lonely
little Creamer girl, and they did not invite Lillie
Treble to go with them.</p>

<p>Nobody could blame them for that breach of
politeness. Dot could not overlook the dreadful
thing Lillie had done to the Alice-doll. Fortunately,
the doll was not wholly ruined—but “no
thanks to Lillie,” as Agnes said.</p>

<p>She never <i>would</i> look like the same doll again.
“She is so pale now,” said Dot, hugging the doll
tightly; “she looks as though she had been
through a dreadful illness. Doesn’t she, Tess?”</p>

<p>“And her beautiful dress and cap all ruined,”
groaned Tess. “It was awfully mean of Lillie.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care so much about the dress,” murmured
Dot. “But the color ran so in her cheeks,
and one of her eyes is ever so much lighter blue
than the other.”</p>

<p>“We’ll play she <i>has</i> been sick,” said Tess.
“She’s had the measles, like Mabel’s sisters.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” cried Dot, who believed in the verities
of play-life. “Oh, no! it would not be nice
to have all the other dolls quarantined, like Mabel
is.”</p>

<p>Mabel was not very happy on this morning, it
proved. Her face was flushed when she came to
the fence, and she spoke to the Kenway girls
hoarsely, as though she suffered from a cold.</p>

<p>“Come on over here and play. I’m tired of
playing so at arm’s length like we’ve been doing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we couldn’t,” said Tess, shaking her head
vigorously.</p>

<p>“Why not? <i>You</i> haven’t quarantine at your
house,” said Mabel, pouting.</p>

<p>“Mrs. McCall says we mustn’t—nor you
mustn’t come over here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” began Mabel, but Tess broke in
cheerfully, with:</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s keep on using the make-believe telephone.
And let’s make believe the river’s in a
flood between us, and the bridges are all carried
away, and——”</p>

<p>“No! I won’t play that way,” cried Mabel,
passionately, and with a stamp of her foot. “I
want you to come over here.”</p>

<p>“We can’t,” said Tess, quite as firmly.</p>

<p>“You’re mean things—there now! I never did
like you, anyway. I want you to play in my
yard——”</p>

<p>“<i>I’ll</i> come over and play with you,” interposed
a cool, sweet voice, and there was Lillie Treble,
looking just as angelic as she could look.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lillie!” gasped Tess. But Mabel broke
in with:</p>

<p>“Come on. There’s a loose picket yonder.
You can push it aside. Come on over here, little
girl, and we’ll have a good time. I never did like
those stuck-up Kenway girls, anyway.”</p>

<p>Lillie turned once to give Tess and Dot the full
benefit of one of the worst grimaces she could possibly
make. Then she joined the Creamer girl in
the other yard. She remained over there all the
morning, and for some reason Mabel and Lillie
got along very nicely together. Lillie could be
real nice, if she wanted to be.</p>

<p>That afternoon Mabel did not appear in her
yard and Lillie wandered about alone, having
sworn eternal enmity against Tess and Dot. The
next morning Mrs. Creamer put her head out of
an upstairs window of the cottage and told Mrs.
McCall, who chanced to be near the line-fence between
the two places, that Mabel had “come
down” with the measles, after all the precautions
they had taken with her.</p>

<p>“It’s lucky those two little girls over there
didn’t come into our yard to play with her,” said
Mrs. Creamer. “The other young ones are just
beginning to get around, and now Mabel will have
to have a spell. She always was an obstinate
child; she couldn’t even have measles at a proper
and convenient time.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Treble, meantime, was feeling herself
more and more at home in the old Corner House.
She did not offer to help in the general housework
in the least, and did nothing but “rid up” her own
room. There could be nothing done, or nothing
talked of in the family, that Mrs. Treble was not
right there to interfere, or advise, or change, or
in some way “put her oar in,” as Agnes disrespectfully
said, to the complete vexation of the
person most concerned.</p>

<p>In addition, morning, noon and night she was
forever dinning the fact into the ears of the girls,
or Mrs. McCall, or Aunt Sarah, or Uncle Rufus,
that her husband’s mother was Uncle Peter Stower’s
own sister. “John Augustus Treble talked
a lot about Uncle Peter—always,” she said. “I
had a little property, when I married John Augustus.
It was cash money left from my father’s
life insurance.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t a very good business man, John
Augustus. But he meant well,” she continued.
“He took my money and started a little store with
it. He took a lease of the store for three years.
There was a shoe factory right across the street,
and a box shop on one hand and a knitting mill
on the other. Looked like a variety store ought
to pay in such a neighborhood.</p>

<p>“But what happened?” demanded Mrs. Treble,
in her most complaining tone. “Why, the shoe
factory moved to Chicago. The box shop burned
down. The knitting mill was closed up by the
sheriff. Then the landlord took all John Augustus’
stock for payment of the rent.</p>

<p>“So he had to go to work in the powder mill,
and that finally blew him up. But he always said
to me: ‘Now, don’t you fuss, Emily, don’t you
fuss. When Uncle Peter Stower dies, there’ll be
plenty coming to us, and you’ll live like a lady the
rest of <i>your</i> life.’ Poor fellow! If I hadn’t seen
him go to work that morning, I’d never have believed
it was the same man they put into his coffin.”</p>

<p>When she told this version of the tale to Aunt
Sarah, and many more details, Aunt Sarah never
said a word, or even looked as though she heard
Mrs. Treble. The old lady’s silence and grimness
finally riled Mrs. Treble’s temper.</p>

<p>“Say!” she exclaimed. “Why don’t you say
something? John Augustus’ mother came from
Milton when she was a girl. You must have
known her. Why don’t you say something?”</p>

<p>At last Aunt Sarah opened her lips. It was the
second time in their lives that the Kenway girls
had ever heard the old lady say more than two sentences
consecutively.</p>

<p>“You want me to say something? Then I
will!” declared Aunt Sarah, grimly, and her eyes
flashing. “You say your husband’s mother was
Peter Stower’s sister, do ye? Well! old Mr.
Stower never had but one child by his first wife,
before he married my mother, and that child was
Peter. Peter didn’t have any sister but these
gals’ mother, and myself. You ain’t got no more
right in this house than you would have in the
palace of the King of England—and if Ruth Kenway
wasn’t foolish, she’d put you out.”</p>

<p>Agnes was delighted at this outbreak. It
seemed that Aunt Sarah must speak with authority.
Ruth was doubtful; she did not know which
lady to believe. Mrs. Treble merely tossed her
head, and said it was no more than she had expected.
Of course, Aunt Sarah would back up
these Kenway girls in their ridiculous claim to the
estate.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me! I do wish Mr. Howbridge would
return home,” groaned Ruth.</p>

<p>“I’d put them both out,” declared Agnes, who
could scarcely control her dislike for the lady from
Ypsilanti and her bothersome little girl.</p>

<p>The neighbors and those acquaintances whom
the girls had made before began to take sides in
the matter. Of course, Miss Titus had spread the
tidings of the coming of Mrs. Treble, and what
she had come for. The lady herself was not at all
backward in putting her story before any person
who might chance to call upon the Corner House
girls.</p>

<p>Some of these people evidently thought Mrs.
Treble had the better right to Uncle Peter’s property.
It was well known by now, that no will had
been offered for probate. Others were sure, like
Aunt Sarah, that Uncle Peter had had no sister
save the girls’ mother.</p>

<p>The minister’s wife came to call—heard both
sides of the argument—and told Ruth she was
doing just right. “It was a kindly thing to do,
Ruth,” she said, kissing the girl, warmly. “I do
not believe she has any claim upon the estate.
There is a mistake somewhere. But you are a
good girl, and Mr. Howbridge will straighten the
matter out, when he comes—never fear.”</p>

<p>But before the lawyer came, something occurred
which seemed to make it quite impossible for Ruth
to ask Mrs. Treble to go, even had she so desired.
Lillie came down with the measles!</p>

<p>She had caught the disease that morning she
had played with Mabel Creamer, and to Dot’s horror,
“quarantine” came into the old Corner
House. Ruth was dreadfully afraid that Dot and
Tess might catch the disease, too, for neither of
them had had it. Although the doctor said that
Lillie had the disease in a light form, Ruth kept
the younger girls as far away from the Trebles’
apartment as she could, and even insisted upon
Mrs. Treble taking her meals up stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Howbridge came home at last. Ruth had
left a note at his office explaining her trouble, and
the lawyer came over to the old Corner House the
day following his return.</p>

<p>He listened to Ruth’s story without comment.
Then he went up stairs and talked with Mrs. Treble.
From the sound of Mrs. Treble’s high-pitched
voice, that must have been rather a stormy
interview. Mr. Howbridge was quite calm when
he came down to the girls again.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir!” Agnes cried, unable to restrain
herself any longer. “You are not going to let her
put us out of this dear old house, are you!”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t worry about that, my dear. Not
yet, at least,” returned Mr. Howbridge, kindly.
But to Ruth he said: “It is an utterly unexpected
situation. I am not prepared to give an opinion
upon the woman’s claim.</p>

<p>“However, I think you are a brave girl, Miss
Kenway, and I approve of all you have done.
You have made a good impression upon the people
here in Milton, I am sure. Yes; you did quite
right. Don’t worry about money matters. All
the bills shall be paid.</p>

<p>“But, my dear, I wish more than ever that we
could find that will. That would settle affairs immediately,
and unless she tried to break the will
in the courts, she would have no standing at all.
Of course, it is for the little girl she claims a part
of Mr. Peter Stower’s property. She, personally,
has no rights herself, even if her tale is true.”</p>

<p>Ruth knew that he was perplexed, however, so
her own heart was but little relieved by the lawyer’s
visit.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink21'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XXI—THE CORNER HOUSE GIRLS WIN PUBLIC APPROVAL</a></h2>

<p>Was it Mr. Howbridge’s wish, or her own desire,
that set Ruth the very next day at the task
of searching the garret thoroughly? She allowed
only Agnes to go up with her; Tess and Dot were
out of the house, Mrs. McCall was busy, and the
lady from Ypsilanti was engaged in nursing her
little daughter.</p>

<p>These days they were much relieved of Mrs.
Treble’s interference in their affairs. Lillie
claimed all her mother’s attention, and although
the child was not very ill, she managed to take up
almost every moment of her mother’s time.</p>

<p>Agnes was frankly scary about the huge lumber-room
at the top of the house. Despite Ruth’s
declaration that they would use the garret to play
in on stormy days, they had not often gone there
for that—nor for any other—purpose.</p>

<p>The girls had removed all the ancient garments
and aired them. Many were moth-eaten and past
redemption; those went to the ragman. Others
were given to Petunia Blossom to be fixed over
for her growing family. Some of the remainder
were hung up again, shrouding one dark corner
of the garret in which Ruth knew there was neither
box, nor chest, nor trunk.</p>

<p>It was the chests of drawers, and boxes, the two
girls gave their attention to on the occasion of this
search. Before, Ruth had opened several of the
old-fashioned receptacles and rummaged in the
contents. Now she and Agnes went at the task
methodically.</p>

<p>Everything was taken out of the chests, and
boxes, and drawers, and shaken out before being
put back again. The girls came upon many unexpected
treasures, and Agnes soon forgot her
fear of the supposed ghostly occupant of the garret.</p>

<p>Ruth, however, would not allow her to stop and
try on wonderful ancient garments, or read yellowed
letters, bound with faded tape, or examine
the old-fashioned gift-books, between the leaves
of which were pressed flowers and herbs, all of
which, Agnes was sure, were the souvenirs of
sentiment.</p>

<p>Oh, yes! there were papers—reams and reams
of them! But they were either letters of no moment
to the quest in hand, or ancient documents
of no possible use save for their historical value.
They came upon some papers belonging to the
original Peter Stower—the strong, hard-working
man who had built this great house in his old age
and had founded the family.</p>

<p>He had been an orphan and had been sheltered
in the Milton poorhouse. Here was his
“indenture paper,” which bound him to a blacksmith of
the town when he was twelve years old. As Ruth
and Agnes read the faded lines and old-fashioned
printing, they realized that the difference between
an apprentice in those days in the north, and a
black slave in the south, was all in favor of the last
named.</p>

<p>But this “bound boy” had worked, studied
nights so as to get some education, had married
his master’s daughter, and come in time to be heir
to his business. He had taken contracts for furnishing
the ironwork for government warships,
and so, little by little, had risen to be a prosperous,
then a very wealthy man.</p>

<p>The old Corner House was the fruit of his labor
and his desire to establish in the town of his miserable
beginnings, a monument to his own pluck
and endeavor. Where he may have been scorned
for the “bound boy” that he was, he took pride
in leaving behind him when he died the memory
only of a strong, rich, proud man.</p>

<p>The girls found nothing which the last Peter
Stower could have considered—whether he were
miser, or not—of sufficient value to hide away.
Certainly no recently dated papers came to light,
and no will at all, or anything that looked like such
a document.</p>

<p>They ransacked every drawer, taking them out
of the worm-eaten, shaky pieces of furniture, and
rummaging behind them for secret panels and the
like. Actually, the only thing the girls found that
mystified them at all in their search, was half a
doughnut lying on a window sill!</p>

<p>“Whoever left that doughnut there?” demanded
Agnes. “I don’t believe the girls have been up
here alone. Could that Lillie have been here?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” sighed Ruth. “She was going
everywhere about the house, before she was taken
down sick.”</p>

<p>“It’s a blessing she’s sick—that’s what <i>I</i> say,”
was Agnes’ rather heartless reply. “But—a
doughnut! and all hard and dry.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it was Dot’s goat?” chuckled Ruth,
nervously.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” gasped Agnes. “My nerves are all
on the jump as it is. Is there any single place in
this whole garret that we haven’t looked?”</p>

<p>Ruth chanced to be staring at the doughnut on
the window sill, and did not at first answer. That
was the window at the right of the chimney where
she had seen the ghostly apparition fluttering in
the storm. The space about the window remained
cleared, as it was before.</p>

<p>“Wake up!” commanded Agnes. “Where shall
we look now?”</p>

<p>Ruth turned with a sigh and went toward the
high and ornate black-walnut “secretary” that
stood almost in the middle of the huge room.</p>

<p>“Goodness to gracious!” ejaculated the younger
girl. “We’ve tried that old thing again and
again. I’ve almost knocked the backboards off,
pounding to see if there were secret places in it.
It’s as empty as it is ugly.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” sighed Ruth. “It’s strange,
though, that Uncle Peter did not keep papers in
it, for that is what it was intended for. Almost
every drawer and cupboard in it locks with a different
key.”</p>

<p>She had been given a huge bunch of keys by Mr.
Howbridge when they first came to the Corner
House; and she had used these keys freely in
searching the garret furniture.</p>

<p>As they went hopelessly down to the third floor,
at last, Ruth noticed that one of the small chambers
on this floor, none of which the family had
used since coming to Milton, had been opened.
The door now stood ajar.</p>

<p>“I suppose that snoopy Mrs. Treble has been up
here,” said Agnes, sharply. “I thought all these
doors were locked, Ruth?”</p>

<p>“Not all of them had keys. But they were all
shut tightly,” and she went to this particular room
and peered in.</p>

<p>The bed was a walnut four-poster—one of the
old-fashioned kind that was “roped”—and the
feather-bed lay upon it, covered with an old-fashioned
quilt.</p>

<p>“Why! it looks just as though somebody had
been sleeping here,” gasped Ruth, after a moment.</p>

<p>“What?” cried Agnes. “Impossible!”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t that look like the imprint of a body
on the bed? Not a big person. Somebody as big
as Tess, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t Tess, I am quite sure,” declared
Agnes.</p>

<p>“Could it have been Sandy-face?”</p>

<p>“Of course not! No cat would make such a big
hollow, lying down in a bed. I know! it was that
Lillie Treble—‘Double Trouble’! Of course,”
concluded Agnes, with assurance.</p>

<p>So Ruth came out and closed the door carefully.
Had it not been for her sister’s assurance at just
this moment, Ruth might have made a surprising
discovery, there and then!</p>

<p>She had to report to Mr. Howbridge, by note,
that a thorough search of the garret had revealed
nothing which Uncle Peter Stower could have hidden
away.</p>

<p>While Lillie was under the doctor’s care, Mrs.
Treble was out of the way. Affairs at the old
Corner House went on in a more tranquil way.
The Creamer girls who had first been ill, were allowed
out of doors, and became very friendly with
Tess and Dot—over the fence. The quarantine
bars were not, as yet, altogether down.</p>

<p>Maria Maroni came to see them frequently, and
Alfredia Blossom brought her shining black face
to the old Corner House regularly, on Mondays
and Thursdays. Usually she could not stop to
play on Monday, when she and Jackson came for
the soiled clothes, but if Petunia got the ironing
done early enough on Thursday, Alfredia visited
for a while.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Alfredia could be any nicer, if
she was bleached white,” Dot said, seriously, on
one occasion. “But I know she’d like to be like
us—and other folks, Tess.”</p>

<p>“I expect she would,” agreed Tess. “But we
must treat her just as though her skin was like
ours. Ruth says she is sure Alfredia’s heart is
white.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Dot. “And they showed us in
school before we left Bloomingsburg, pictures of
folks’ hearts, and lungs, and livers—don’t you remember?
And the heart was painted <i>red</i>.”</p>

<p>“I don’t expect they were photographs,” said
Tess, decidedly. “And there aren’t any pictures
exact but photographs—and movies.”</p>

<p>The Pease girls came frequently to play with
Tess and Dot, and the younger Kenways went to
<i>their</i> house. None of the Corner House girls
could go out on the street now without being
spoken to by the Milton people. Many of these
friendly advances were made by comparative
strangers to the four sisters.</p>

<p>The tangle of Uncle Peter Stower’s affairs had
gotten even into the local newspapers, and one
newspaper reporter came to Ruth for what he
called “an interview.” Ruth sent him to Mr.
Howbridge and never heard anything more of it.</p>

<p>The friends Agnes had made among the girls
of her own, and Ruth’s, age began to come to call
more frequently. Eva Larry admitted she felt
shivery, whenever she approached the old house,
and she could not be hired to come on a stormy
day. Just the same, she was so sorry for the girls,
and liked Agnes so much, that she just <i>had</i> to run
in and cheer them up a bit.</p>

<p>Older people came, too. Ruth’s head might
have been turned, had she been a less sensible
girl. The manner in which she handled the situation
which had risen out of Mrs. Treble’s coming
east to demand a share of the property left by
Peter Stower, seemed to have become public knowledge,
and the public of Milton approved.</p>

<p>Nobody called on Mrs. Treble. Perhaps that
was because she was quarantined upstairs, with
Lillie convalescent from her attack of the measles.
However, the Corner House girls, as they were
now generally called, seemed to be making friends
rapidly.</p>

<p>Public approval had set its seal upon their
course.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink22'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XXII—CALLERS—AND THE GHOST</a></h2>

<p>“I do wonder!” said Tess, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“What do you wonder?” asked Ruth, mildly.</p>

<p>“Sounds like a game,” Agnes observed, briskly.
The Corner House girls were sitting on the porch
with their sewing, and it was a very warm August
forenoon. “‘Cumjucum—what do you come by?
I come by the letter T’—which stands for ‘Tess’
and ‘Trouble,’ which last is the expression on
Tess’ face,” concluded Agnes, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Tess’ train of thought was not to be sidetracked
so easily. “I wonder whatever became of Tommy
Rooney?” she said.</p>

<p>“You don’t really believe that was Tommy you
saw the day it rained so hard?” cried Agnes.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. And we know that Tommy stole
cherries from Mr. Pease, and milk from Mrs. Adams.
Didn’t he, Dot? And then, we saw Mr.
Pinkney and that bulldog chasing him.”</p>

<p>“He ran into our yard to escape the dog,” said
Dot, seriously.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ruth, “if it was Tommy, I wish
he had come to the house, so we could have fed
him. Mrs. Rooney must be awfully worried about
him. It’s been a month since we heard he had run
away.”</p>

<p>“And he’d been gone a week, then,” added Agnes.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tess, “I guess he hasn’t killed any
Indians here in Milton, or we would have heard
about it.”</p>

<p>“I guess not,” chuckled Agnes.</p>

<p>“I always look for him, when I’m on the street,”
said Dot.</p>

<p>“We’ll look for him to-day,” said Tess, “when
we go to see Maria.”</p>

<p>Tess and Dot were going over to Meadow Street
that afternoon to call on the Maronis and Mrs.
Kranz. The condition of the Maronis had greatly
improved during these weeks. Not only Joe and
Maria, but the whole family had begun to be proud
of living “like Americans.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Kranz, out of the kindness of her heart,
had helped them a great deal. Maria helped the
good German lady each forenoon, and was learning
to be a careful little housekeeper.</p>

<p>“She iss a goot mädchen,” declared the large
lady. “Aind’t idt vonderful how soon dese foreigners
gets to be respectable, ven dey iss learndt
yet?”</p>

<p>Tess and Dot went up stairs to make themselves
ready for their visit, before luncheon. Upon their
departure, Eva Larry and Myra Stetson appeared
at the front gate.</p>

<p>“Oh, do come in, girls!” shouted Agnes, dropping
her sewing.</p>

<p>“We will, if you’ll tie up your ghost,” said Eva,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Hush!” commanded Ruth. “Don’t say such
things—not out loud, please.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Eva said, as she and Myra joined them
on the porch, “I understand you have ransacked
that old garret. Did you chase out Mr. Ghost?”</p>

<p>“What is that?” demanded Mrs. Treble’s shrill
voice in the doorway. “What does that girl mean
by ‘ghost’?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Treble!” cried the teasing Eva.
“Haven’t you heard of the famous Garret Ghost
of the old Corner House—and you here so long?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t!” begged Ruth, sotto voce.</p>

<p>Mrs. Treble was not to be denied. Something
evidently had escaped her curiosity, and she felt
cheated of a sensation. “Go on and tell me, girl,”
she commanded Eva.</p>

<p>Eva, really nothing loath, related the story of
the supposed supernatural occupant of the garret.
“And it appears on stormy, windy days. At least,
that’s when it’s been seen. It comes to the window
up there and bows, and flutters its grave
clothes—and—and all that.”</p>

<p>“How ridiculous!” murmured Ruth. But her
face was troubled and Mrs. Treble studied her accusingly.</p>

<p>“That’s why you forbade my Lillie going up
there,” she said. “A ghost, indeed! I guess you
have something hidden up there, my girl, that you
don’t want other folks to see. You can’t fool me
about ghosts. I don’t believe in them,” concluded
the lady from Ypsilanti.</p>

<p>“Now you’ve done it, Eva,” said Agnes, in a
low voice, when Mrs. Treble had departed.
“There isn’t a place in this house that she hasn’t
tried to put her nose in <i>but</i> the garret. Now she’ll
go up there.”</p>

<p>“Hush,” begged Ruth, again. “Don’t get her
angry, Agnes.”</p>

<p>“Oh! here comes Mr. Howbridge!” exclaimed
the other Kenway girl, glad to change the subject.</p>

<p>Ruth jumped up to welcome him, and ushered
him into the dining-room, while the other girls remained
upon the porch. As she closed the door,
she did not notice that Mrs. Treble stood in the
shadow under the front stairs.</p>

<p>“I have been to see this Mrs. Bean,” said the
lawyer, to Ruth, when they were seated. “She is
an old lady whose memory of what happened when
she was young seems very clear indeed. She does
not know this Mrs. Treble and her child personally.
Mrs. Treble has not been to see her, since
she came to Milton.”</p>

<p>“No. Mrs. Treble has not been out at all,” admitted
Ruth.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bean,” pursued Mr. Howbridge, “declares
that she knew Mr. Treble’s mother very
well, as a girl. She says that the said mother of
John Augustus Treble went west when she was a
young woman—before she married. She left behind
a brother—Peter Stower. Mrs. Bean has always
lived just outside of Milton and has not, I
believe, lived a very active life, or been much in
touch with the town’s affairs. To her mind, Milton
is still a village.</p>

<p>“She claims,” said Mr. Howbridge, “to have
heard frequently of this Peter Stower, and when
she heard he had died, she wrote to the daughter-in-law
of her former friend. That is her entire
connection with the matter. She said one very
odd thing. That is, she clearly remembers of having
hired Peter Stower once to clean up her yard
and make her garden. She says he was in the
habit of doing such work at one time, and she
talked with him about this sister who had gone
west.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Ruth.</p>

<p>“It does not seem reasonable,” said Mr. Howbridge.
“There is a mixup of identities somewhere.
I am pretty sure that, as much as Mr.
Peter Stower loved money, he did not have to earn
any of it in such a humble way. It’s a puzzle.
But the solving of the problem would be very easy,
if we could find that lost will.”</p>

<p>Ruth told him how she and Agnes had thoroughly
examined the garret and the contents of
the boxes and furniture stowed away there.</p>

<p>“Well,” sighed the lawyer. “We may have to
go into chancery to have the matter settled. That
would be a costly procedure, and I dislike to take
that way.”</p>

<p>Directly after luncheon Tess and Dot started
off for Meadow Street with the convalescent
Alice-doll pushed before them in Dot’s doll-carriage.
Mrs. Treble, who had begun to eat down
stairs again, although Lillie was not allowed out
of her room as yet, marched straight up stairs,
and, after seeing that Lillie was in order, tiptoed
along the hall, and proceeded up the other two
flights to the garret door.</p>

<p>When she opened this door and peered into the
dimly lit garret, she could not repress a shudder.</p>

<p>“It is a spooky place,” she muttered.</p>

<p>But her curiosity had been aroused, and if Mrs.
Treble had one phrenological bump well developed,
it was that of curiosity! In she stepped, closed
the door behind her, and advanced toward the middle
of the huge, littered room.</p>

<p>A lost will! Undoubtedly hidden somewhere in
these old chests of drawers—or in that tall old
desk yonder. Either the Kenway girls have been
very stupid, or Ruth has not told that lawyer
the truth! These were Mrs. Treble’s unspoken
thoughts.</p>

<p>What was that noise? A rat? Mrs. Treble
half turned to flee. She was afraid of rats.</p>

<p>There was another scramble. One of the rows
of old coats and the like, hanging from nails in the
rafters overhead, moved more than a little. A rat
could not have done that.</p>

<p>The ghost? Mrs. Treble was not at all afraid of
such silly things as ghosts!</p>

<p>“I see you there!” she cried, and strode
straight for the corner.</p>

<p>There was another scramble, one of the Revolutionary
uniform coats was pulled off the hook on
which it had hung, and seemed, of its own volition,
to pitch toward her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Treble screamed, but she advanced. The
coat seemed to muffle a small figure which tried to
dodge her.</p>

<p>“I have you!” cried Mrs. Treble, and clutched
at the coat.</p>

<p>She secured the coat itself, but a small, ragged,
red haired, and much frightened boy slid out of
its smothering folds and plunged toward the door
of the garret. In trying to seize this astonishing
apparition, Mrs. Treble missed her footing and
came down upon her knees.</p>

<p>The boy, with a stifled shout, reached the door.
He wrenched it open and dove down the stairway.
His bare feet made little sound upon the bare
steps, or upon the carpeted halls below. He
seemed to know his way about the house very well
indeed.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Treble reached the stairs and came
down, heavily, shrieking the alarm, nobody in the
house saw the mysterious red haired boy. But
Uncle Rufus, called from his work in the garden,
was amazed to see a small figure squeezing through
a cellar window into the side-yard. In a minute
the said figure flew across to the street fence,
scrambled over it, and disappeared up Willow
Street, running almost as fast as a dog.</p>

<p>“Glo-ree!” declared the black man, breathlessly.
“If dat boy keeps on runnin’ like he’s
done started, he’ll go clean ’round de worl’ an’ be
back fo’ supper!”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink23'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XXIII—NOT ENTIRELY EXPLAINED</a></h2>

<p>Joe Maroni smiled at Tess and Dot broadly, and
the little gold rings in his ears twinkled, when the
girls approached his fruit stand.</p>

<p>“De litla ladies mak’ Joe ver’ hap’—come to
see-a he’s Maria. Maria, she got da craz’ in da
head to wait for to see you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope not, Mr. Maroni,” said Tess, in her
most grown-up way. “I guess Maria isn’t crazy,
only glad.”</p>

<p>“Glad a—si, si! Here she come.”</p>

<p>Maria, who always was clean and neat of dress
now, appeared from the cellar. She was helping
her mother draw out the new baby carriage that
Joe had bought—a grand piece of furniture, with
glistening wheels, varnished body, and a basket
top that tipped any way, so as to keep the sun out
of the baby’s eyes.</p>

<p>The baby was fat again and very well. He
crowed, and put his arms out to Tess and Dot,
and the latter was so delighted with him that she
almost neglected the Alice-doll in <i>her</i> carriage.</p>

<p>The little Maronis thought that big doll and its
carriage were, indeed, very wonderful possessions.
Two of the smaller Maronis were going walking
with the visitors, and Maria and the baby.</p>

<p>Joe filled the front of the baby carriage with
fruit, so that the children would not be hungry
while away from the house. Off the procession
started, for they had agreed to go several blocks
to the narrow little park that skirted the canal.</p>

<p>It was a shady park, and the Kenway girls and
the clean, pretty Maroni children had a very nice
time. Maria was very kind and patient with her
sisters and with the baby, and nothing happened
to mar the afternoon’s enjoyment until just as the
children were about to wheel the baby—and the
doll—back to Meadow Street.</p>

<p>What happened was really no fault of any of
this little party in whom we are interested. They
had set off along the canal path, when there suddenly
darted out of some bushes a breathless, hatless
boy, whose tangled hair was fiery red!</p>

<p>Tess shrieked aloud. “Why! Tommy Rooney!
Whatever are you doing here?”</p>

<p>The boy whirled and stared at Tess and Dot,
with frightened countenance. Their appearance
in this place evidently amazed him. He stumbled
backward, and appeared to intend running away;
but his foot tripped and he went down the canal
bank head-first!</p>

<p>Splash he went into the murky water, and disappeared.
The girls all screamed then; there
were no grown folk near—no men at all in sight.</p>

<p>When Tommy Rooney came to the surface he
was choking and coughing, and paddled for only
a moment, feebly, before going under again. It
was plain that he could not swim.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” cried Dot. “He’ll be drowned.
Tommy Rooney will be drowned! And what will
his mother say to <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>Tess wrung her hands and screamed for help.
But there <i>was</i> no help.</p>

<p>That is, there would have been none for poor
Tommy, if it had not been for quick-witted Maria
Maroni. Quickly she snatched the baby from the
carriage and put him into Tess’ arms. Then she
flung out the pillows and wrappings, and ran the
carriage to the brow of the canal-bank.</p>

<p>Up came Tommy again, his eyes open, gurgling
a cry, and fighting to keep above the surface.</p>

<div style='text-align:center'>
<img id='ilink04' src='images/illus-004.jpg' alt=''/>
<p class='caption'>Up came Tommy again, his eyes open, gurgling a cry, and fighting to keep above the surface.</p>
</div>

<p>“Look out, boy!” cried Maria, and she ran the
baby carriage right down the bank, letting it go
free.</p>

<p>The carriage wheeled into the water and
floated, as Maria knew it would. It was within
the reach of Tommy’s still sturdy hands. He
grabbed it, and although it dipped some, it bore
up his weight so that he did not sink again.</p>

<p>By that time men had heard their cries, and came
running from the lock. They soon fished out
Master Tommy and the baby carriage, too.</p>

<p>“You’re a smart little kid,” said one of the
men, to Maria, and he gave her a silver dollar.
Meanwhile the other man turned Tommy across
his knee to empty the water out of his lungs.
Tommy thought he was going to get a spanking,
and he began to struggle and plead with the
man.</p>

<p>“Aw, don’t, Mister! I didn’t mean to fall into
your old canal,” he begged, half strangling. “I
didn’t hurt the water none.”</p>

<p>The men laughed. “You ought to get it—and
get it good,” he said. “But perhaps the dip in
the canal was punishment enough for you. I’ll
leave it to your mother to finish the job right.”</p>

<p>“Say! does he belong to these little girls?”
asked the other man. “He’s no Italian.”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s two girls who are not Italians,
either,” said the other rescuer.</p>

<p>“He’ll go home with us,” declared Tess, with
confidence. “If he doesn’t, we’ll tell his mother,
and she’ll send a policeman after Tommy.”</p>

<p>“Guess the little lady knows what she’s about,”
laughed the man. “Come on, Jim. The boy’s so
water-soaked that it’s pretty near put his hair out.
No danger of much fire there now.”</p>

<p>Maria was afraid of what her father would do
and say when he saw the condition of the new
baby carriage. She carried the baby home in
her arms, while her little sisters carried the pillows
and other things. Tess ordered Tommy
Rooney to push the carriage.</p>

<p>Tess was very stern with Tommy, and the latter
was very meek. Naturally, he was much subdued
after his involuntary bath; and he was worried,
too.</p>

<p>“You—you going to make me go clear home
with you, Tess Kenway?” he finally asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the boy, with a sigh, “they’ll just
about kill me there.”</p>

<p>“What for?” demanded Tess and Dot, in
chorus.</p>

<p>“Guess you warn’t at home an hour ago?” said
Tommy, a faint grin dawning on his face.</p>

<p>“No. We came over here right after lunch,”
said Tess.</p>

<p>“Wow! wait till you hear about it,” groaned
Tommy. “Just wait!” and he refused to explain
further.</p>

<p>At the Meadow Street fruit stand, there was
great excitement when the procession appeared.
Mrs. Maroni feared that it was the baby who had
fallen into the canal and she ran out, screaming.</p>

<p>Such a chattering Tess and Dot had never heard
before. Joe and his wife and all the children—including
Maria and the baby—screeched at the
top of their voices. Somehow an understanding
of the facts was gathered by Mr. and Mrs. Maroni,
and they began to calm down.</p>

<p>Then Tess put in a good word for Maria, and
told Joe that she had saved the life of Tommy, who
was a friend of theirs—and a friend of the “litla
Padrona,” as Joe insisted upon calling Ruth.</p>

<p>So the excitable Italian was pacified, and without
visiting Mrs. Kranz on this occasion, Tess and
Dot bade the Maronis good-by, kissed the baby,
and with Tommy Rooney started for home.</p>

<p>As they approached the old Corner House,
Tommy grew more and more disturbed. He was
not likely to get cold, if his garments <i>were</i> wet,
for the day was very warm. Anyway, he wore
so few garments, and they were so ragged, that
it did not seem to matter much, whether he removed
them in going in swimming, or not!</p>

<p>“You girls better go ahead and tell ’em,” suggested
Tommy, at last.</p>

<p>“Tell ’em what?” demanded Tess.</p>

<p>“Tell ’em——Well, tell ’em I’m coming. I
wouldn’t want to frighten your sisters—and—and
that woman.”</p>

<p>“No, we won’t,” said Tess. “You are fixing
to run away again. Don’t you dare even <i>start</i>,
Tommy Rooney.”</p>

<p>“Well,” grunted Tommy. “There’s something
going to happen, when we get there.”</p>

<p>“Nothing’s going to happen. How you talk!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes there is. I scared that woman pretty
near into fits.”</p>

<p>“What woman?” demanded Tess and Dot, together.</p>

<p>Tommy refused to be more explicit. They came
in sight of the Corner House. As they entered
by the back gate, Ruth and Agnes rushed out upon
the rear porch, having caught sight of Tommy’s
disreputable figure.</p>

<p>“There he is!” they shrieked.</p>

<p>Mrs. McCall was visible behind them. She said
something far more practical. She demanded:
“Is that the boy that’s been stealing my pies and
doughnuts?”</p>

<p>Tommy shrank back and turned to flee. But
Uncle Rufus darted out from behind the woodshed
and caught him.</p>

<p>“Glo-ree! is dis de leetle rapscallion I done see
squeezin’ out of dat cellar winder? An’ I declar’!
I didn’t t’ink nobody more’n a cat could git in
an out o’ dat winder.”</p>

<p>A window opened above, and Mrs. Treble put
out her head. “Hold him till I come down there,”
she ordered. “That little tyke tried to play ghost
and scare me. I’ll fix him.”</p>

<p>She banged the window again, and was evidently
hastening down stairs. Even Dot turned
upon the truant:</p>

<p>“Have you been living in our garret, Tommy
Rooney?” she cried.</p>

<p>Tommy nodded, too full for utterance at that
moment.</p>

<p>“And we thought it was a goat!” declared Dot.</p>

<p>“And you ate the cookies and doughnuts Mrs.
McCall missed,” accused Agnes.</p>

<p>Tommy nodded.</p>

<p>“And the dolls’ dinner out of our room,” cried
Dot. “And we thought it was Sandy-face.”</p>

<p>“Ah—well——I was starvin’,” confessed
Tommy.</p>

<p>At this point Tess came to the front again.
She stood before Tommy, and even put Uncle
Rufus firmly, though gently, aside.</p>

<p>“Stop!” she said to the wrathful Mrs. Treble,
when that lady appeared. “Tommy is a friend
of ours. And he’s been ’most drowned. You
wouldn’t want to punish him any more to-day.
Dot and I invited him home, and you mustn’t all
<i>pounce</i> on him this way. You know, his mother’s
a long way from here, and he hasn’t seen her
lately, and—and he’s sorry anyway. And it must
be just <i>awful</i> to be so hungry that you have to
<i>steal</i>.”</p>

<p>At this point gentle Tess’ eyes ran over, and
she turned to take the red haired boy’s hand. To
her amazement, Tommy’s grimy face was likewise
streaked with tears.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink24'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XXIV—AUNT SARAH SPEAKS OUT</a></h2>

<p>Tommy Rooney’s capture explained some of the
mysterious happenings about the old Corner
House, but he could not satisfy Ruth regarding the
figure she had seen appear at the garret window.
For <i>that</i> happened before Tommy had ever been
in the house.</p>

<p>They were all kind to Tommy, however—all but
Mrs. Treble—after Tess had pleaded for him.
Mrs. McCall washed his face and hands, and even
kissed him—on the sly—and then set him down
to a very satisfying meal. For as often as he had
raided Mrs. McCall’s pantry at night since taking
up his abode in the garret of the old Corner House,
he had not had a real “<i>square</i>” meal for a month.</p>

<p>The house was so big that, by keeping to the
two upper floors of the main part during the daytime,
and venturing out-of-doors by way of the
cellar window only at night, Master Tommy had
been able to avoid the family for weeks.</p>

<p>He had entered the house first on that evening
when he was chased by Mr. Pinkney and the bulldog.
Finding the back door open, he had run up
the back stairs, and so climbed higher, and higher,
until he reached the garret.</p>

<p>Nobody said anything to Master Tommy about
the ghost, although Agnes wanted to. Ruth forbade
her to broach the subject to the runaway.</p>

<p>Tommy had made a nest behind the old clothes,
but some nights he had slept in a bed on the third
floor. The day Ruth and Agnes ransacked the
garret for Uncle Peter’s will, he had been down
in that third floor room. When Ruth discovered
the print of his body on the feather-bed, he was on
the floor, under that bed, hidden by the comforter
which hung down all around it.</p>

<p>He was pretty tired of the life he had been leading.
He admitted to the Corner House girls that
he had not seen a single Indian in all his wanderings.
He was ready to go home—even if his
mother thrashed him.</p>

<p>So Ruth telegraphed Mrs. Rooney. She took
Tommy to a nearby store and dressed him neatly,
if cheaply, and then bought his ticket and put him
in the care of the conductor of the Bloomingsburg
train. Tommy, much wiser than he had been,
and quite contrite, went home.</p>

<p>“I s’pose he’s a dreadful bad boy,” sighed Dot.
“But my! no girl would ever have such things
happen to her—would she?”</p>

<p>“Would you want to be chased by bulldogs, and
live in garrets, and steal just enough to keep alive—and—and
never have on anything clean, Dot
Kenway?” demanded Tess, in horror.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t s’pose I would,” confessed Dot.
Then she sighed, and added: “It’s <i>awful</i>
commonplace, just the same, bein’ a girl, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I agree with you, Dot-ums,” cried Agnes, who
heard her. “Nothing ever happens to us.”</p>

<p>Almost on the heels of that statement, however,
something happened to them that satisfied even
Agnes’ longing for romance, for some time thereafter.</p>

<p>It was on Saturday that Tommy Rooney went
home to his anxious mother. The weather had
been of a threatening character for several days.
That night the wind shrieked and moaned again
around the old Corner House and the rain beat
with impotent hands against the panes.</p>

<p>A rainy Sunday is not often a cheerful day.
Ruth Kenway always tried to interest her sisters
on such occasions in books and papers; or they
had quiet talks about “when mother was with us,”
or those more ancient times “before father went
away.”</p>

<p>If they could possibly get to Sabbath School on
such stormy days, they did so. This particular
mid-August Sunday was no exception.</p>

<p>The rain ceased for a while about noon and the
four set forth, under two umbrellas, and reached
the church in season. They were glad they had
come, so few scholars were there, and they helped
swell the attendance.</p>

<p>Coming home, it rained a little, and their umbrellas
were welcome. Tess and Dot were under
the smaller umbrella and the older girls had the
larger one. Coming across the parade ground,
the path they followed approached the old Corner
House from the side.</p>

<p>“Oh, see there!” cried Tess, suddenly. “Somebody’s
waving to us from the window.”</p>

<p>“What window?” demanded Agnes, with sudden
nervousness, trying to tip up the big umbrella,
so that she could see, too.</p>

<p>“Why!” cried Tess. “It’s in the garret.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see it!” agreed Dot.</p>

<p>“Oh! mercy me!” groaned Agnes.</p>

<p>“Stop that!” gasped Ruth, shaking her by the
arm. “You want to scare those children?”</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s the ghost,” whispered Agnes, too
afraid to look again.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot were merely curious. Ruth had
seen the waving figure. Immediately it seemed
to leap upward and disappear.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose it was Lillie?” asked Tess.</p>

<p>“We’ll find out when we go in,” said Ruth, in a
shaken voice.</p>

<p>Agnes was almost in tears. She clung to Ruth’s
arm and moaned in a faint voice:</p>

<p>“I don’t want to go in! I never want to go into
that horrid old house again.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense you do talk, Ag,” said Ruth,
as the little girls ran ahead. “We have been all
over that garret. We know there is really nothing
there——”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” groaned Agnes. “It <i>must</i> be
a ghost.”</p>

<p>Ruth, unhappy as she felt, determined to
discover the meaning of that spectral figure. “Let’s
go right up there and find out about it,” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ruth!”</p>

<p>“I mean it. Come on,” said the older sister, as
they entered the big hall.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot heard her, and clamored to go,
too, but Ruth sent the smaller girls back. At the
head of the front stairs, they met Mrs. Treble.</p>

<p>“Have you, or Lillie, been up in the attic?”
asked Ruth, sharply. “There was something at
the window up there——”</p>

<p>“What are you trying to do, girl?” demanded
the lady from Ypsilanti, scornfully. “Trying to
scare me with a ridiculous ghost story?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what it is,” said Ruth. “I mean
to find out. Were you up there?”</p>

<p>“I should have gone to the garret had I wished,”
Mrs. Treble said, scornfully. “You must have
something hidden away there, that you don’t want
me to see. I wonder what it is?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Treble!” began Ruth, and just then
she saw that Aunt Sarah’s door was open. Aunt
Sarah stood at the opening.</p>

<p>“Niece Ruth!” exclaimed the old lady, harshly,
“why don’t you send that woman away? She’s
got no business here.”</p>

<p>“I’ve more right here than <i>you</i> have, I should
hope,” cried Mrs. Treble, loudly. “And more
right than these girls. You’ll all find out when
the courts take the matter up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Treble! We none of us know——”</p>

<p>“Yes we do, too,” declared the lady from Ypsilanti,
interrupting Ruth. “My husband’s mother
was Peter Stower’s sister. Perhaps my Lillie
shall have <i>all</i> the property—and this ugly old
house, too. I tell you what I’ll do first thing,
when it comes into my hands as guardian of my
child.”</p>

<p>Ruth and Agnes were speechless. Mrs. Treble
was more passionate than she had ever been before.</p>

<p>“I shall tear this ugly old house down—that’s
what I’ll do,” Mrs. Treble declared. “I’ll raze
it to the ground——”</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah suddenly advanced into the hall.
Her black eyes flashed as though there were sparks
in them.</p>

<p>“You will do <i>what</i>?” she asked, in a low, hoarse
voice.</p>

<p>“I’ll tear down the house. It is no good.”</p>

<p>“This beautiful old house!” groaned Agnes, forgetting
about the ghost at that moment.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah’s wrath was rising. It broke the
bonds she had put upon her tongue so many years
before.</p>

<p>“You will tear this house down?” she repeated.
“Niece Ruth! is there any chance of this
woman getting control of Peter’s property?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know,” said Ruth desperately. “If
we can’t find Uncle Peter’s will that Mr. Howbridge
made, and which leaves the estate to you
and us girls, Aunt Sarah—”</p>

<p>“There never was such a will,” put in Mrs.
Treble.</p>

<p>“Mr. Howbridge says there was. He thinks
Mr. Stower must have hidden it away with other
papers, somewhere in the house——”</p>

<p>“And I know where,” said Aunt Sarah, speaking
out at last. “Peter never thought I knew
where he hid things. But I did. You gals come
with me.”</p>

<p>She stalked toward the stairs that led upward.
Ruth and Agnes, half awed by her manner and
speech, followed her. So did Mrs. Treble.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah went directly to the garret. Agnes
forgot to be scared of the ghost they had seen from
outside, in her interest in this affair.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah went to the old secretary, or desk,
standing in the middle of the garret floor.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve looked all through <i>that</i>,” whispered
Agnes.</p>

<p>“You did not look in the right place,” said Aunt
Sarah.</p>

<p>Quite calmly she tapped with her fingers upon
a panel in one end of the old desk. In a moment
the panel dropped down, leaving in view a very
narrow depository for papers. It was crammed
with documents of several different kinds.</p>

<p>Mrs. Treble sprang forward, with a cry. But
Aunt Sarah got in front of her. She seized her
skirts with both hands and advanced upon the
lady from Ypsilanti with belligerence.</p>

<p>“Shoo!” said Aunt Sarah. “Shoo!”</p>

<p>As Mrs. Treble retreated, Aunt Sarah advanced,
and, as though she were “shooing” a refractory
chicken, she drove the lady from Ypsilanti
out of the garret and closed the door firmly
in her face.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink25'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XXV—LAYING THE GHOST</a></h2>

<p>Mr. Howbridge came by request to the Corner
House the next morning. Ruth had slept all night
with the papers found in the old secretary under
her pillow.</p>

<p>Mr. Howbridge came into the dining-room where
the four Corner House girls were assembled, smiling
and evidently in right good humor. “I understand
you have made a wonderful discovery,
Miss Kenway?” he said.</p>

<p>“It was Aunt Sarah,” said Agnes, excitedly.
“<i>She</i> knew where the papers were.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” said the lawyer, interested.</p>

<p>“We have found some of Uncle Peter’s papers,
that is sure,” said Ruth. “And among them is
one that I think must be the will you spoke of.”</p>

<p>“Good! we shall hope it is the paper we have
been looking for,” said Mr. Howbridge, accepting
the packet Ruth handed him. “And <i>I</i> have made a
discovery, too.”</p>

<p>“What is that, sir?” asked Ruth, politely.</p>

<p>“It refers to Mrs. Treble’s claim to the estate
of Mr. Peter Stower.”</p>

<p>“If little Lillie bears any relationship to Uncle
Peter, she must have her just share of the estate.
We could agree to nothing else,” Ruth hastened
to say.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ruth!” exclaimed Agnes.</p>

<p>Mr. Howbridge adjusted his glasses and looked
at Ruth quizzically. “Miss Kenway,” he said,
“you are a remarkable girl. Lillie Treble is the
daughter of John Augustus Treble, without a
doubt. <i>His</i> mother went west from Milton, years
ago, as is claimed. But she was <i>not</i> Peter Stower’s
sister.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goody!” ejaculated Agnes, clapping her
hands.</p>

<p>“Who was she?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p>Mr. Howbridge laughed softly. “She was the
sister of a man named Peter <i>Stover</i>. The names
are similar, but there is a difference of one letter—and
many other differences, it seems. Peter
Stover was a poor man all his days. He was an
‘odd job’ man most of his life, working about the
farms on the outskirts of Milton, until he grew infirm.
He died last winter at the poorfarm.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bean, even, remembers the name right
now. These Trebles evidently heard of the wealth
of your Uncle Peter, and thought he was <i>their</i>
Uncle Peter. The names were so much alike, you
see.”</p>

<p>“Then—then Mrs. Treble and Lillie have no
claim upon Uncle Peter’s estate at all?” asked
Ruth.</p>

<p>“No more than the Man in the Moon,” said Mr.
Howbridge, still smiling.</p>

<p>“And you know <i>he</i> isn’t any relation,” whispered
Tess, to Dot, with great importance.</p>

<p>“The poor things!” Ruth sighed. “Whatever
will they do?”</p>

<p>“Why, Ruth Kenway!” exclaimed Agnes, in
great excitement. “What are you thinking of?
I should think you had done enough for them.”</p>

<p>Ruth only looked at her, and went on talking to
the lawyer. “You see, sir,” she said, “they are
quite penniless. I know, for Mrs. Treble broke
down and cried about it last night, when I read
to her the provisions of what I supposed to be
Uncle Peter’s will.</p>

<p>“She spent the last money she had in getting
here from Ypsilanti. She has thoroughly believed
that Lillie was to come into the money. Now,
what <i>can</i> she do?”</p>

<p>“Go back to Ypsilanti,” put in Agnes, sharply.</p>

<p>“I wonder if her relatives will take her in again
if she goes back?” said Ruth slowly.</p>

<p>“Ahem!” said Mr. Howbridge, clearing his
throat. “I have been in correspondence with a
Mr. Noah Presley, her brother-in-law. He says
he was opposed to her coming east without knowing
more of the situation here and her own rights.
Now he says she and Lillie may come back, if——wait!
I will read you exactly what he says,” and
Mr. Howbridge drew forth the letter in question.
He cleared his throat again and read:</p>

<p>“‘Tell Emily she can come back here if she
wants, providing she’ll mind her own business
and keep that dratted young one of hers from turning
the house upside down. I can’t pay her fare
to Ypsilanti, but I won’t refuse her a home.’”</p>

<p>“You can easily see what <i>he</i> thinks of them,”
declared Agnes, grimly.</p>

<p>“Do hush, dear,” begged Ruth. “Then you
will pay their fare back for them, will you not,
Mr. Howbridge?” pursued Ruth. “And we shall
see that they are comfortably clothed. I do not
think they have <i>many</i> frocks.”</p>

<p>“You are really a very remarkable girl, Miss
Kenway,” said Mr. Howbridge again. That was
the settlement of the Trebles’ affairs. Two weeks
later the Corner House girls saw the Ypsilanti
lady and her troublesome little girl off on the train
for the west.</p>

<p>At this particular Monday morning conference,
the lawyer made it clear to the Kenway girls that,
now the will had been found, the matters of the
estate would all be straightened out. Unless they
objected, he would be appointed guardian as well
as administrator of the estate. There was plenty
of cash in the bank, and they were warranted in
living upon a somewhat better scale than they
had been living since coming to the old Corner
House.</p>

<p>Besides, Ruth, as well as the other girls, was
to go to school in the autumn, and she looked forward
to this change with delight. What she and
her sisters did at school, the new friends they
made, and how they bound old friends to them
with closer ties, will be set forth in another volume,
to be called “The Corner House Girls at
School.”</p>

<p>A great many things happened to them before
schooldays came around. As Tess declared:</p>

<p>“I never did see such a busy time in this family—did
you, Dot? Seems to me we don’t have time
to turn around, before something new happens!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad things happen,” quoth Dot,
gravely. “Suppose nothing ever <i>did</i> happen to
us? We just might as well be asleep all the time.”</p>

<p>First of all, with the mystery of Uncle Peter’s
will cleared away, and the status of Mrs. Treble
and Lillie decided, Ruth went at the mystery which
had frightened them so in the garret. Even Agnes
became brave enough on that particular Monday
to go “ghost hunting.”</p>

<p>They clambered to the garret and examined the
window at which they thought they had seen the
flapping, jumping figure in the storm. There was
positively nothing hanging near the window to
suggest such a spectral form as the girls had seen
from the parade ground.</p>

<p>“And this is the window,” said Ruth, thoughtfully.
“To the right of the chimney——Oh! goodness
me, what a foolish mistake!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter now?” asked the nervous
Agnes, who did not dare approach very near the
window.</p>

<p>“Why, it wasn’t this window at all,” Ruth said.
“Don’t you see? It was to the right of the
chimney <i>from the outside</i>! So it is on the left of the
chimney up here. It is the other window.”</p>

<p>She marched around the big bulge of the chimney.
Agnes held to her sleeve.</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” she said, faintly. “It was a
ghost just the same——”</p>

<p>There was another window just like the one they
had formerly looked at. Only, above the window
frame was a narrow shelf on which lay a big,
torn, home-made kite—the cloth it was covered
with yellowed with age, and the string still
fastened to it. In cleaning the garret, this kite
had been so high up that none of them had lifted
it down. Indeed, the string was fastened to a
nail driven into a rafter, above.</p>

<p>Even now there was a draught of air sucking
in around the loose window frame, and the kite
rustled and wabbled on its perch. Ruth ran forward
and knocked it off the shelf.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” shrieked Agnes.</p>

<p>The kite dangled and jumped right before the
window in such a manner that it must have looked
positively weird from the outside. It was more
than half as tall as a man and its crazy motions
might well be taken for a human figure, from a
distance.</p>

<p>Suddenly the boisterous wind seized it again
and jerked it back to its perch on the shelf. There
it lay quivering, until the next gust of wind should
make it perform its ghostly dance before the garret
casement.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t that great!” gasped Agnes. “And
it must have been there for years and years—ever
since Uncle Peter was a boy, perhaps. Now! what
do you suppose Eva Larry will say?”</p>

<p>“And other people who have been afraid to come
to the old Corner House?” laughed Ruth. “Oh,
I know! we’ll give a ghost party up here in the
garret.”</p>

<p>“Ruth!” screamed Agnes in delight. “That
will be just scrumptious!”</p>

<p>“We shall celebrate the laying of the ghost.
No! don’t touch it, Agnes. We’ll show the girls
when they come just what made all the trouble.”</p>

<p>This the Corner House girls did. They invited
every girl they had become acquainted with in
Milton—little and big. Even Alfredia Blossom
came and helped Uncle Rufus and Petunia Blossom
wait upon the table.</p>

<p>For the first time in years, the old Corner House
resounded to the laughter and conversation of a
great company. There was music, too, and Ruth
opened the parlors for the first time. They all
danced in those big rooms.</p>

<p>Mr. Howbridge proved to be a very nice guardian
indeed. He allowed Ruth to do pretty much
everything she wanted. But, then, Ruth Kenway
was not a girl to desire anything that was not good
and sensible.</p>

<p>“It’s dreadfully nice to feel <i>settled</i>,” said Tess
to Dot and Maria Maroni, and Margaret and
Holly Pease, and the three Creamer girls, as they
all crowded into the summer house the afternoon
of the ghost laying party.</p>

<p>“Now we <i>know</i> we’re going to stay here, so we
can make plans for the future,” pursued Tess.</p>

<p>“Yes,” observed Dot. “I’m going right to work
to make my Alice-doll a new dress. She hasn’t had
anything fit to wear since that awful time she was
buried alive.”</p>

<p>“Buried alive!” shrieked Mabel Creamer.
“How was <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And they buried her with some dried
apples,” sighed Dot. “She’s never been the same
since. You see, her eyes are bad. I ought to
take her to an eye and ear infernery, I s’pose; but
maybe even the doctors there couldn’t help her.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s <i>infernery</i>, Dot,” said Tess,
slowly. “That doesn’t sound just right. It
sounds more like a conservatory than a hospital.”</p>

<p>“Well, <i>hospital</i>, then!” exclaimed Dot. “And
poor Alice! I don’t suppose she ever <i>will</i> get the
color back into her cheeks.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t think she would, if she’s been buried
alive,” said Mabel, blankly.</p>

<p>The two youngest Kenways had been very glad
to see Lillie Treble go away, but this was almost
the only comment they ever made upon that angel-faced
child, before company. Tess and Dot <i>were</i>
polite!</p>

<p>That was a lovely day, and the Corner House
girls all enjoyed the party immensely. Good Mrs.
McCall was delighted, too. She had come to love
Ruth and Agnes and Tess and Dot, almost as
though they were her own. Ruth had already engaged
a strong girl to help about the kitchen work,
and the widow had a much easier time at the old
Corner House than she had at first had.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah appeared at the party, when the
dancing began, in a new cap and with her knitting.
She had subsided into her old self again, immediately
after her discovery of Uncle Peter’s secret
panel in the old secretary in the garret. She
talked no more than had been her wont, and her
knitting needles clicked quite as sharply. Perhaps,
however, she took a more kindly interest in
the affairs of the Corner House girls.</p>

<p>She was not alone in that. All the neighbors,
and the church people—indeed everybody in Milton
who knew Ruth Kenway and her sisters at all—had
a deep interest in the fortunes of the Corner
House girls.</p>

<p>“They are a town institution,” said Mr. Howbridge.
“There is no character sweeter and finer
than that of Ruth Kenway. Her sisters, too, in
their several ways, are equally charming.</p>

<p>“Ruth—Agnes—Tess—Dot! For an old bachelor
like me, who has known no family—to secure
the confidence and liking of such a quartette of
young folk, is a privilege I fully appreciate. I
am proud of them!”</p>
